1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,518
My goal in this video is todisplay a list of comics,      

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,931
maybe ten comics at most,for the currently selected      

3
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:19,951
character that we was able toachieve in the previous video.      

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,460
And the good news is that we'vealready got a template for how      

5
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:26,620
it should work, we're just gonnaneed to call a different API,      

6
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:28,740
we'll get to thatin just a moment.      

7
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,540
Before we do that while I'm herein the developer portal, we were      

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:36,180
talking about attributionpreviously on this page, but      

9
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:40,000
there's also something we needto consider with regard to      

10
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:40,770
rate limits.      

11
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:45,210
Notice here that it says,most services default to 1,000      

12
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:49,680
calls per day but some servicesmay have different rate limits.      

13
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,720
So if this applicationbecomes popular,      

14
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:58,460
that means at most it canonly be launched 1,000 times      

15
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:03,531
by all customers combined.      

16
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,690
And that's the best-casescenario where every request      

17
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,420
comes through successfully,and it doesn't take three or      

18
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:13,920
four requests to get allthe data that we need.      

19
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,010
So if this were a realapplication that I plan      

20
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,670
on distributing tothe world at large,      

21
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:26,570
I would reconsider the waythat I go about this.      

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,690
One of two things, I wouldeither require end users to get      

23
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:35,640
their own key, which is kind of,that's a lot of friction in      

24
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:39,770
the process, or I might actuallycreate a web service similar to      

25
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:43,300
what we did inthe UWP weather app.      

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,460
I would make a callfrom my local app      

27
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:53,010
to the web service sitting inAzure or wherever, and it would      

28
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:57,170
then go out to the Marvel API,make the necessary call,      

29
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:01,250
grab the data andthen cache it locally.      

30
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:06,642
Now, you can see that you can,in fact, cache results, save      

31
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:11,750
them off locally for a periodof time, at most 24 hours.      

32
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:15,206
But as they say, the data doeschange on a regular basis so      

33
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:17,798
you can't just put itin the database, and      

34
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:19,670
store it until the end of time.      

35
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,934
If you do, you're breakingthe agreement that you have with      

36
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,050
Marvel, andtheir usage of their API.      

37
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:29,210
And also, we can't just go offand grab the entire database      

38
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:33,070
in one shot, it says onlymake the calls that you need.      

39
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:36,951
So, what I would understand thatto be is I can make a call for      

40
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:40,912
one client, and then cache offthe data that I get from him and      

41
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,570
hold on to it forno more that 24 hours.      

42
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:47,418
The second client makes aconnection and it requests data      

43
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,702
and I can grab data forhim and cache him as well and      

44
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,730
then a third client requestsdata and I can get data for her.      

45
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:57,183
And so now I have datafrom three clients and      

46
00:02:57,184 --> 00:03:01,010
I'm making these calls, at somepoint I'm going to get an error.      

47
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,990
Where does that specify there?      

48
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:06,572
Yeah, you're gonna geta return code of 429,      

49
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:09,570
which means you'vemade too many calls.      

50
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:13,110
At that point, I can startserving up from my local cache.      

51
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,330
Does that make sense?      

52
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:17,499
That's not what we're gonnado in this application, but      

53
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,955
if I really wanted touse this going forward,      

54
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:22,490
that's how I would goabout it at a high level.      

55
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:29,743
Let's now navigate to ourinteractive documentation      

56
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:35,037
because what I need to do isfind a list of comics for      

57
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:37,190
a given character.      

58
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:42,106
And so I spent some time andI went through all the different      

59
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:46,018
API's I could call andhow I could call them and      

60
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,450
I settled onthe /public/comics API.      

61
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:51,396
And if you take a look,      

62
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,600
you can give an optionalrange of characters, so      

63
00:03:55,601 --> 00:04:00,727
return only comics which featurethe specified characters      

64
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:05,770
that accepts a comma separatedlist of IDs, good enough.      

65
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:11,024
So for demonstration purposes,I'm gonna grab the real      

66
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:16,825
Spider-Man, the ID forSpider-Man is 1009610, and      

67
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:21,870
I'm gonna limit the numberof comics returned to ten.      

68
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:25,630
And so let's try that out.      

69
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:29,250
All right, it looks like I haveall the data that I need there.      

70
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:34,113
Let me see if I can just grab,I need to grab that out,      

71
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:37,882
let's go all the wayhere to the bottom.      

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,750
Probably should restrictthis actually, let me make      

73
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:48,410
the call again, but I'm justgonna limit it to two comics.      

74
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:51,445
Why two,because I don't want just one,      

75
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:55,000
I want it to show a collectionand I don't want ten      

76
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,930
because it's just too muchto give to json2csharp.      

77
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,445
So let's scroll up andgrab all this stuff,      

78
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:07,385
we've done this before, right,we're just doing it now for      

79
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,950
comics instead of characters.      

80
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:15,230
Great, okay, we'll go ahead andcopy all that.      

81
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,403
We'll go into json2csharp and      

82
00:05:18,404 --> 00:05:23,810
I'm gonna paste all that in,I'll click Generate and      

83
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:29,110
then I am going to scroll tothe bottom and copy it all.      

84
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,771
Ctrl+C to copy to my clipboard,then what I wanna do is come      

85
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:36,215
over here to my Models folderin my Solution Explorer and      

86
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:40,020
I'm gonna go to the Projectmenu and select Add Class.      

87
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:43,555
And I'm gonna call thisclass ComicDataWrapper,      

88
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:48,420
because that is what theycall it on their side and      

89
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,550
I want to use the same term.      

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,619
Then I'm going to highlight theComicDataWrapper class stub that      

91
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,847
they give us and just Ctrl+V andpaste in all of our data and      

92
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:06,890
I'm going to rename this toComicDataWrapper like so.      

93
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,700
Now you'll noticeas we go up here,      

94
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:13,670
you'll see some redsquiggly lines under a few      

95
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:17,980
of the items andthe reason for this is that we      

96
00:06:17,981 --> 00:06:21,060
already have a class namedEvents in the same name space.      

97
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:24,922
Now I could either add, put thisin a different name space and      

98
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:27,728
it wouldn't be inheroexplorer.models,      

99
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:31,850
it would be hero.explorer.modelsdot I don't know, comic?      

100
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:35,421
Or I could just simplyremove these and      

101
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:38,330
rely on the other definition.      

102
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,354
The other definitionto work in that case,      

103
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:57,450
and that's what I'mgonna choose to do.      

104
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:01,521
I'm gonna also remove this Item3because you'll notice that      

105
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,824
Stories containsa list of items and      

106
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:06,830
those items would beindividual story items.      

107
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:10,635
So I'm just gonna delete that,we're already accounted for      

108
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:12,910
that, I'm gonnaget rid of Events.      

109
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:17,995
And in this case,the ComicDataWrapper will have      

110
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:23,926
a reference to data which wouldbe a comic data container,      

111
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,952
which has a list of results and      

112
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:31,210
those result objects are comics,okay?      

113
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:36,007
So actually, let me go ahead andchange that,      

114
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:40,558
let me change this, andlet me change this to      

115
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:46,100
ComicDataContainer andwe'll change that as well.      

116
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:50,240
All right, so that's how ourclass structure should look now.      

117
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,699
And then what I'll needto do is go into our      

118
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,490
Facade andI'm going to create something      

119
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:06,860
almost identical to thisGetCharacterDataWrapperAsync,      

120
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,570
I'm gonna do the same thing forComic.      

121
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:12,930
So, in fact,I'm just gonna copy all of this,      

122
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,330
the entire method,copy it and then paste it.      

123
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,493
Now a lot of this will berepeatable so I'm going to pare      

124
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:30,328
these down, take out the commoncode that I need, and      

125
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,350
then put that ina helper method.      

126
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,210
So, I have to figure outwhat it is I need first.      

127
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:41,683
Let's go back to our call here,      

128
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:46,548
and this is the request URL so      

129
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:52,427
I'm gonna grab allof this here and      

130
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:58,508
I'm gonna use thatas the URI here,      

131
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:04,391
replacing pretty much everything      

132
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:11,530
that I don't need to API key,all right?      

133
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:16,070
All right and solet's trim off the API key here.      

134
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,490
And I don't know which, we'llcome back with the numbers.      

135
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,853
I'm gonna limit this to ten,      

136
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,790
let's hard code ten in here fornow.      

137
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:32,890
And the character, we'll haveto pass that in as well.      

138
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:35,776
So I think that's it, soI'm gonna pass in the character,      

139
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:38,710
that'll be the firstthing we replace.      

140
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,510
The API key will bethe second thing we replace,      

141
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:44,520
the time stamp will bethe third thing we replace and      

142
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,186
the hash will be the fourththing we replace.      

143
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,813
So the only thingwe're really replacing      

144
00:09:50,814 --> 00:09:53,195
here is the characters, so      

145
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:57,452
this would be a characteridthat gets passed in.      

146
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:04,905
So we're going to call thisGetComicDataWrapperAsync and      

147
00:10:04,906 --> 00:10:10,530
we're gonna pass inan int characterId.      

148
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:17,510
And I see they'repretty much identical      

149
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:22,450
up to the point when wedeserialize that jsonMessage.      

150
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:25,240
So what I could probablywind up doing here is taking      

151
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,796
all of this code here andputting it into a helper method.      

152
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:32,258
So private static string,      

153
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,622
it'll return the jsonMessage and      

154
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:41,288
this will just beCallMarvel() and      

155
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:44,460
I'll paste all that in.      

156
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:49,434
Now, what we'll need tosend out, let's see.      

157
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,630
Is pretty much everythingup until that API key.      

158
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,556
So if we were topass all of this in.      

159
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:15,477
We'll call this,the URL then I can make the call      

160
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:21,008
to CallMarvel,let's put it right there      

161
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:36,770
Like that, andwe could do that for now.      

162
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,120
We'll come back andreplace that in a minute.      

163
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,050
And let's see whatthe problem is.      

164
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,110
We gotta return something here,yeah.      

165
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:45,462
We'll return that JSON message.      

166
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:53,153
So we'll just return this.      

167
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:03,966
And we'll make this async.      

168
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:10,870
And, which means I'mgonna name this Async.      

169
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:19,040
Now it looks like I have somediscrepancy here with the URL.      

170
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:24,341
Let's call thisthe completeUrl and      

171
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:29,480
we'll pass that in here,like so.      

172
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:32,400
Obviously we're not going tobe passing in characterId,      

173
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:35,440
what we'll do insteadis pass in the URL.      

174
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:42,460
Okay, now what? Right.      

175
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,945
This needs to return a task of      

176
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,112
string.      

177
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:56,896
Perfect, and that should work.      

178
00:12:56,897 --> 00:13:02,352
So, this is gonna becalled CallMarvelAsync and      

179
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:07,010
what we'll get backis the jsonMessage,      

180
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:10,614
so, var jsonMessage = await.      

181
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:15,821
And then we're gonnawanna compose that URL.      

182
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:17,555
So let's go.      

183
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,414
And we'll come back tothat in just a moment too.      

184
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:30,467
All right, so that meansI can get rid of this.      

185
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:40,088
And I can get rid of this,characterId.      

186
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:48,621
And then get rid of all that.      

187
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,567
Okay, now we need to make this.      

188
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:04,523
I'm gonna pass inthe URL like that.      

189
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:08,144
And that should work.      

190
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,710
So I'm gonna dothe same thing up here.      

191
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:17,430
We'll keep that URL butwe can rip all of that out.      

192
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,057
And all of this out.      

193
00:14:29,805 --> 00:14:35,366
Okay, we're gonna go here.      

194
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:46,688
Get rid of everything here,except the offset.      

195
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:59,230
And I think I may haveaccidentally deleted the offset.      

196
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:04,190
So let me put that back in,actually right there.      

197
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,918
Int MaxCharacters, yeah,that's a int, a const.      

198
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:16,259
And we're gonna get back,we'll make the call.      

199
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:24,281
Okay.      

200
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:26,270
So I realize there's a lotof refactoring there but      

201
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:31,130
this is good because now allthe code that deals with      

202
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,420
calling Marvel isin just one method.      

203
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,990
But I can get rid of this,      

204
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:40,340
cuz that's only applicableto one case, great.      

205
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,728
That should work.      

206
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:48,535
All right, so the next thing weneed to do, though, is because      

207
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:53,343
we copied and paste a lot of thecode from here, let's make this      

208
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:57,909
comic data wrapper, notcharacter data wrapper, right?      

209
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:05,785
Okay and we're going to needto do that here as well,      

210
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:07,685
ComicDataWrapper.      

211
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,168
All right, I think we've got it.      

212
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:22,398
Now what we wanna do is, prettymuch, like what we did here,      

213
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,428
where we have another method,and we won't need to do quite as      

214
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:32,774
much effort We will      

215
00:16:32,775 --> 00:16:38,200
need to do that whole thing withthe thumbnail images, right?      

216
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:41,160
Cuz, some of the imagescould come back like that.      

217
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:46,120
So, I'm just gonna copy this,and I'm gonna recreate it for comics      

218
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,690
PopulateMarvelComicsAsync.      

219
00:16:54,691 --> 00:16:58,710
And what we want isObservableCollectionComic to      

220
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,450
be passed in.      

221
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,435
So, instead of MarvelCharacters,it'll be MarvelComics, like so.      

222
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,680
And this would bea comicDataWrapper.      

223
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:20,130
So, get characters would be getcomic and it may not have been      

224
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:24,630
worth it to copy and paste andchange all these references but,      

225
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:29,200
at least we'll get someconsistency out of this.      

226
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:32,340
ComicDataWrapperAsync, didI not call it that?      

227
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:37,630
GetComicDataWrapperAsync, okay,I did.      

228
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,120
All right, and I gotta giveit the ID that I want.      

229
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:47,580
All right, sowe're gonna also pass in the ID.      

230
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:51,334
So, int characterId.      

231
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,676
So we'll give it characterId.      

232
00:17:58,671 --> 00:17:59,217
Like that.      

233
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:04,105
All right so, comicDataWrapper.data.results      

234
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,990
equals comics.      

235
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:09,950
Here we're gonna go for      

236
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:14,306
each comic, in comics and      

237
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:19,775
then comic.thumbnail. ComicCharacter,      

238
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:21,460
comic.thumbnail.path.      

239
00:18:21,461 --> 00:18:23,280
I'm gonna have to make surethat some of these things      

240
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:24,080
are correct.      

241
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,553
I'll take a few minutes andlook through these as well.      

242
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:41,945
I'm pretty surethe same thing applies      

243
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:46,914
to comics that applyto characters.      

244
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:53,091
Okay, nice.      

245
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:01,539
All right, sonow we're gonna call      

246
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:07,980
PopulateMarvelComicsAsync whena given item is selected.      

247
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,860
So, the first thing that we'regonna wanna do is actually      

248
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,120
create a new property.      

249
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:22,368
So prop Tab, Tab, observableCollection<comic>      

250
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,153
called MarvelComics.      

251
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:30,304
Awesome.      

252
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,060
Then I'm gonna want toinitialize it, right?      

253
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,231
MarvelComics = newObservableCollectionComic and      

254
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:46,608
then what I'm gonna dois MarvelComics.clear,      

255
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:51,344
cuz I wanna get rid ofany previous items in it      

256
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:54,423
before I make the next call.      

257
00:19:54,424 --> 00:20:00,091
And then I'm gonna call it,and I'm gonna pass in.      

258
00:20:00,092 --> 00:20:08,736
So, I'm gonna pass inthe character ID so,      

259
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:13,091
let's selectcharacter.id, and      

260
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:19,053
then I'm gonna pass inMarvelComics, like so.      

261
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,470
Let's see what the problem is.      

262
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,178
All right,we need to add async here.      

263
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:30,631
What else is the problem?      

264
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:35,118
I'm kind of a knucklehead there,      

265
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,303
MarvelFacade., there we go.      

266
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,220
Now we're cooking.      

267
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:44,888
Okay.      

268
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:55,727
Now since we're makingthe call out to the API,      

269
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:59,446
what I might wannado is go ahead and      

270
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:03,053
reenact the progress ring here.      

271
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,969
We'll go ahead and      

272
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,262
start it here andend it down here.      

273
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:19,641
All right,let's see if this works.      

274
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:20,990
Oh, I'm a knucklehead.      

275
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:23,052
I forgot the mostimportant part of all.      

276
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:34,644
All right and I see an issuehere, that we already have      

277
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:38,330
a definition for comic andit's dramatically different.      

278
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:42,435
So I'm gonna actuallyname this ComicBook and      

279
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:47,400
the only place I'll need torename it is here, I think.      

280
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:50,420
Well, I guess I'll need torename it a lot of places.      

281
00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:00,487
Wherever I wasdepending on it And,      

282
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:07,070
fortunately it's notthat many places.      

283
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:10,550
I will wanna reconsiderits use here,      

284
00:22:10,551 --> 00:22:11,930
instead of Comic,we want ComicBook.      

285
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:15,830
We don't need that here as well.      

286
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,690
And then when we passin the observable      

287
00:22:21,691 --> 00:22:26,358
collection it'll beComicBook instead of Comic.      

288
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,180
All right,let's see if that works or      

289
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,279
if we have other issues.      

290
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,590
All right, so now on theMainPage.xaml, I need to bind      

291
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:42,600
to that new Marvel Comicscollection.      

292
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:46,469
All right, so let's.      

293
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:54,761
Work inside of here.      

294
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,928
So, I'm gonna callthis List of Comics.      

295
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:06,108
And I'm gonna put another Grid,and this is going to be the,      

296
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:10,344
actually, it's gonnabe a grid view.      

297
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,520
And I'm gonna putthat in grid-row 1.      

298
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:18,679
Lets go ahead and      

299
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,575
set the ItemSource      

300
00:23:24,576 --> 00:23:28,997
equal to x bind      

301
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:35,636
MarvelComicBooks.      

302
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:41,612
And then setthe IsItemClickEnabled equal      

303
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:42,246
to true.      

304
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:44,677
We'll come back to that later.      

305
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:50,177
And then the ItemClickedequals the event handler,      

306
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,178
again we'll comeback to that later.      

307
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:05,794
All right,here what we're gonna do,      

308
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:11,550
Gridview.ItemTemplate andthen DataTemplate.      

309
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,890
And then I'm gonna putthe image of ComicBook there.      

310
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:23,598
So, the image,let's go ahead and      

311
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:30,453
set the x:DataType=Data.ComicBook,      

312
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:37,302
and so the source isgoing to be that large,      

313
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:42,060
so X bind thumbnail.large,      

314
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:45,511
and we'll make the.      

315
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:49,134
Actually, we want it small.      

316
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:51,094
We want the small one.      

317
00:24:52,594 --> 00:24:56,630
But that does make me think thatmaybe I need a different size.      

318
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:59,303
Okay, we'll come back to thatthought in a second here.      

319
00:24:59,304 --> 00:25:04,455
We'll make the Width="100" andthe Height="150",      

320
00:25:04,456 --> 00:25:07,677
and that should prettymuch wrap that up.      

321
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,800
Bound there, bound there.      

322
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:16,450
That looks good.      

323
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:21,939
Here in the facade, whenwe're populating the comics,      

324
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,370
I think I wanna use a differentset of sizes here for these.      

325
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:32,090
So I wanna use portraitin both cases,      

326
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:37,450
cuz comic books are arranged ina portrait not in a standard, so      

327
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:42,380
we'll go medium, portrait mediumand then portrait extra large.      

328
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:44,220
Okay, that should work.      

329
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:46,012
All right let's build it andsee if it works.      

330
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:52,011
It failed.      

331
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:05,110
Hm, I think maybe it's justa naming issue, let's see.      

332
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:07,511
Or, what I'm gonna do?      

333
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:11,844
Yeah, it just should beMarvelComics not ComicBooks.      

334
00:26:15,553 --> 00:26:19,540
All right,      

335
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:23,780
very good.      

336
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:24,280
And let's go.      

337
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:32,070
There we go.      

338
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,928
Look at that,how beautiful that is.      

339
00:26:39,969 --> 00:26:43,534
It looks like it's having a hardtime sometimes with the comics      

340
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,470
for the same reason.      

341
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,720
So we'll come back andfix that on the next video,      

342
00:26:47,721 --> 00:26:49,230
cuz this one's runninga little bit long.      

343
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:50,830
But very cool.      

344
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:54,170
Okay, we'll continue onin the next video and      

345
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:56,250
you click on one of these andwe'll show      

346
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,200
the information about a givenitem, give a comic below it.      

347
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,500
So we'll do that inthe next lesson.      

348
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:04,480
We'll see you there, thanks.
