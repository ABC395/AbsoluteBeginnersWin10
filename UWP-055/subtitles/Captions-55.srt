1
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:08,050
<v ->We're almost at the point where we are</v>

2
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:11,339
going to submit our application for ingestion

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,243
to the Windows Store.

4
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,599
However, before we get to that,

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,204
let me just show you what I did to resolve

6
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:23,106
the issue that we left in the previous lesson.

7
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:27,039
What I did was, I created a simple helper method

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,703
called GoBack that contains

9
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:31,217
all of the functionality necessary

10
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:33,700
to put the application in a valid state

11
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:38,492
after we move away from the,

12
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:41,862
the Search functionality or whenever we hit the BackButton.

13
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:44,582
So that's the purpose of this GoBack method.

14
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,822
We're going to grab all the Sounds,

15
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:50,232
we're going to set that title, that CategoryTextBlock

16
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:55,232
to AllSounds, we're going to set the MenuItemsListView

17
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:56,859
to no selection,

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,294
and then we'll set the BackButton.Visibility to Collapsed.

19
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:01,403
Then I'm going to call that,

20
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,015
whenever you click the BackButton,

21
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:07,633
or whenever the text changes in the SearchAutoSuggestBox.

22
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,384
So, if you clear it out completely,

23
00:01:10,385 --> 00:01:15,213
or if you hit the little X in that AutoSuggestBox.

24
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:19,040
We're going to, first of all, check and see if

25
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,478
that AutoSuggestBox is empty.

26
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,227
And if it is, then we'll call GoBack

27
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:24,870
and then we'll continue on.

28
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,174
So that's how I resolve that issue

29
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:30,224
that we left off with in the previous lesson.

30
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,782
Okay, so the next thing we want to do

31
00:01:31,783 --> 00:01:34,424
is talk about deployment for a little bit,

32
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:36,964
and how your applications will actually be deployed

33
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,341
on the end-user computer.

34
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:41,465
So as a developer, you don't write

35
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:45,433
any installers in your routines to install or uninstall

36
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:48,582
your Windows runtime app, the app that you're building.

37
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,172
Instead, you package your app and you submit it

38
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:54,207
to the Store, like we'll do in the next lesson.

39
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:58,136
So, users will acquire your app from the Store

40
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:01,954
as what's called an "App Package."

41
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,669
The operating system uses information that you supply

42
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,765
in an app package to install the app

43
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:13,496
and ensure that all traces of the app are gone

44
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:17,623
from the device whenever they choose to uninstall that app.

45
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:21,325
So, there's a file called the Package.appxmaninfest file,

46
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:23,074
as you can see I have it highlighted here

47
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:24,568
in the Solution Explorer.

48
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,324
Here let me get it up for you so you can see it.

49
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,925
Alright, and if I double click it you'll see that there's

50
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:33,933
a beautiful designer, but actually what this file is,

51
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:38,031
is just XML, it just has a nice Visual Studio

52
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,156
interface on top of it so you don't have to

53
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:41,762
deal directly with the XML.

54
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:45,597
But essentially that Package.AppXManifest file

55
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,375
is just a document that contains the information

56
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,829
that the system needs to deploy,

57
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,733
to display, or update a Windows app.

58
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:56,930
So this information that it contains

59
00:02:56,931 --> 00:03:01,062
will include things like the identity of the Package,

60
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:04,954
any dependencies that it has on other DLL's

61
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:09,090
or other resources, any capabilities,

62
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:12,034
capabilities that it requires in order to run.

63
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:14,278
So, I need GPS to run.

64
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:19,278
I need to access the file system to run.

65
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,932
Any visual elements, like we're going to demonstrate

66
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,556
in this lesson and extensibility points,

67
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:25,815
which we're not going to talk about.

68
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:28,355
So every app package must include

69
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:31,196
at least one Package.AppXManifest file.

70
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:34,087
So, the package manifest is digitally signed

71
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,498
as a part of signing the app package.

72
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:40,316
After it's been signed, then you can't modify the manifest

73
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,684
without invalidating the package signature.

74
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:45,795
So there's a certain amount of security then

75
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:48,775
for the end user to ensure that they're getting

76
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,437
the application that you built

77
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,708
and that somebody didn't hack in

78
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,436
and make some changes to it

79
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,691
before it gets installed in their computer.

80
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,681
So after the package has been installed

81
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:59,985
and the package manifest file appears

82
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:04,273
in the directory for the install package.

83
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:06,321
Okay so, as you can see, there are

84
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:10,611
a number of tabs in this designer.

85
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:15,611
Things that are related to the Application as a whole,

86
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:18,076
any 'Visual Assets', that's where we're going to spend

87
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:19,588
the majority of our time,

88
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,340
'Capabilities', here's where I say,

89
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,426
"hey, I need the internet, I need the microphone,

90
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:24,796
"I need to make a phone call."

91
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,042
That's what my app needs.

92
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:30,855
Any 'Declarations'

93
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:34,161
These are things that I intend to change or provide

94
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:39,161
as a service to the device or the system I'm running on.

95
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,078
'Content URIs', I'm not all that familiar with honestly,

96
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:47,274
but the 'Packaging' is important

97
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:48,746
from a Window's Store perspective,

98
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,410
nothing that we really need to change,

99
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:54,524
unless we update the version number of our application

100
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:57,045
and obviously, we'll want to change who the publisher is.

101
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,477
I'll go ahead and change that right now.

102
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:01,376
So, let's go over to 'Application'.

103
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:03,146
I think the only change I want to make is

104
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:05,734
how it's actually displayed in the Store.

105
00:05:05,735 --> 00:05:09,539
And then, I might change the description as well.

106
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,151
'Plays fun sounds

107
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:22,151
'to amuse and amaze friends.'

108
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,906
Alright, probably need a better description than that,

109
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,459
but that should suffice.

110
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,571
The 'Supported rotations',

111
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:30,695
we haven't really tested it a lot,

112
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,402
but I'm going to go ahead and select

113
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,623
all of the rotations since we've programmed it

114
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:38,930
in such a way that it should be able to handle it,

115
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:40,914
but ideally, we would test this a little bit more

116
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:43,709
before we just went off and made those selections.

117
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,946
We're not going to do any Tile Updates.

118
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:46,850
We'll talk about those in just a moment.

119
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,573
But we are going to do is spend time

120
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:50,782
talking about 'Visual Assets'.

121
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,610
So, let me go ahead and

122
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:59,610
add in the short name of the application: UWP SoundBoard.

123
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,310
And where I want to show that name,

124
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:04,978
which versions of the logo, alright.

125
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,940
And it's going to say, hey that's great,

126
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:09,074
but you don't have a 310x310 logo.

127
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:10,588
We'll fix that in just a moment.

128
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,018
Now before we get too far into this,

129
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,150
let me talk about, first of all,

130
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,838
let me show you a good page that you need to take a look at.

131
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,016
It's bit.do/tiles-badges

132
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:25,016
and so, you can see here, on the the screen right now,

133
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:30,090
this is a documentation from the user experience.

134
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:36,316
Guidelines that talks about the various ways

135
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:38,470
that visual assets will be used on the device

136
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:41,999
on the start screen or on the start menu.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,071
And, I'm not going to take the time to cover all of these.

138
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,533
There's actually quite a long list,

139
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:49,329
but let me give you a few definitions to begin with here.

140
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,333
A tile is anything, and unfortunately,

141
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:52,421
it's going to be off to the left hand side

142
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:53,765
of the screen here,

143
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,409
but you can see, like, this is a tile,

144
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,847
this Movies & TV tile, this Groove Music tile,

145
00:06:57,848 --> 00:06:59,562
this News Tile, okay.

146
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:04,562
Different orientations and what they do

147
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,813
are a little bit differently, because you can see

148
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:10,313
that there are some, the News Items has a photograph,

149
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:12,809
but ultimately, those are all tiles,

150
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,456
in a very general sense.

151
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:16,141
Now, there is something called a 'Live tile',

152
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:20,667
which is, that which typifies that what they called

153
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:23,177
Metro or Modern User Interface,

154
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:27,632
where there are, there's information that gets flipped.

155
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,726
New information, different information,

156
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:31,071
so if you have a news application,

157
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:34,769
you might show three or four news stories

158
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,706
in sequence or give some sort of an update.

159
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,024
But this, too, is kind of a general heading for

160
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,847
specific types of live tiles.

161
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,283
For example, there are 'Tile notifications'.

162
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:47,435
And these are usually, like, if you see a mail program,

163
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,011
you have six new emails, okay.

164
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,655
There's usually a little badge at the bottom

165
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:54,507
with a number that tells you how many

166
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,652
items are new and updated and require your attention.

167
00:07:57,653 --> 00:07:59,486
Then are things called badges,

168
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,322
and that will show, actually badges

169
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:05,062
show you the number of items.

170
00:08:05,063 --> 00:08:10,062
Tile notifications are pieces of information

171
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,182
that are specific on a per user basis.

172
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:14,901
So if I'm playing a video game,

173
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:19,092
and my ship actually lands at a planet three hours later,

174
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:21,692
after I sent it there, then I might get

175
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:24,552
a notification, a tile notification that says,

176
00:08:24,553 --> 00:08:27,372
"Hey, it's time to come back and play now,

177
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,873
"there's action that you can take."

178
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,382
Then there's 'Badges', like we talked about,

179
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:34,326
number of six messages that need your attention.

180
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:35,645
And then there's a 'Peek template',

181
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:39,135
where you can actually see portions of the content,

182
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:44,135
like, maybe a photo that will be utilized

183
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,720
if you were to then launch the application from that tile,

184
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:50,910
so you get to peek at the content inside of that tile,

185
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:53,516
using a peek template.

186
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:56,381
And, again, you can take a look at these guidelines,

187
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:58,941
probably the biggest one that is pertinent to us,

188
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,650
for our application is that we should only use

189
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,144
a small and medium tile.

190
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:08,144
So there are different size tiles, as you can see here,

191
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:10,969
there are different size and shape tiles,

192
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,560
and one of the guidelines is you shouldn't use a large tile,

193
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,906
if you're not using tile notifications

194
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,338
and if you're not using badges,

195
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,130
so we should only use small and medium,

196
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:24,715
not the larger ones, okay.

197
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:26,808
Now you'll notice that by default,

198
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:30,703
there are a number of assets that are already,

199
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:33,379
kind of, predefined for you.

200
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,557
For example, this square 150x150 logo.

201
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:40,312
You can see that,

202
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,853
that by, well first of all, let me go to All Image Assets,

203
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:45,539
then that'll give us a longer list,

204
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,205
that usually what you can do is just

205
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:50,658
choose one of the recommended sizes

206
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,282
or two of the recommended sizes and the other scales

207
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:56,866
will be automatically generated for you.

208
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,105
Now what I've gone off and done,

209
00:09:58,106 --> 00:10:01,940
because I wasn't really entirely sure

210
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,501
what I needed to provide.

211
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,721
I went off and told my graphic designer to,

212
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:08,498
"Hey, give me my little logo here

213
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:12,783
in all these different variety of sizes that they ask for."

214
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:15,455
And then, I might come back and then

215
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:18,995
remove the ones that don't make a whole lot of sense.

216
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:22,104
So, I'm going to take some time here and change out,

217
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:25,709
like for example, the square 71x71 logo.

218
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,479
I might go here to the little ellipses

219
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,251
to actually select an image file to copy in this slot.

220
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:35,203
I'm going to go into the Assets folder,

221
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:37,912
into my PackageAppXManifest folder,

222
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:42,540
and I'm looking for the 71x71 image, like so.

223
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,915
Now it says that it doesn't like my naming convention

224
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:50,683
and that it has to provide some scaling

225
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:55,084
information, kind of, sandwiched between the 71x71

226
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,792
and the .png, do you want to proceed?

227
00:10:56,793 --> 00:10:59,330
Absolutely, go right ahead.

228
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:03,490
Okay and, so you can see that it puts it there now.

229
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:06,554
I can also add a background color.

230
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:11,216
I think we'll just add a background color of,

231
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:13,154
well, in the case of the tiles,

232
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:15,287
we want the background color to be transparent

233
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:17,847
because we want to use whatever the system colors are,

234
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:19,749
but for the splash screen, let's use red.

235
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,788
Let's see if it'll accept that.

236
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,329
We'll come back to that in a little bit.

237
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,667
All right, so let's go ahead and continue on here.

238
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:30,453
I'll choose a 300x300.

239
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,605
Okay so, I think that's pretty much everything

240
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:43,529
that I want to change about this.

241
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,883
So let's close this now and what I want to do

242
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:48,073
before we leave this topic,

243
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:52,233
is actually right-click the Package.AppXManifest file

244
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:54,729
and just say, Open With,

245
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,759
and I'm just going to open with the Text Editor,

246
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
or maybe just the XML Text Editor and click OK.

247
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,063
And then you can see all of the settings that we made

248
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:09,235
in that designer and you can see how they're manifest here

249
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,879
in the XML, alright?

250
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,655
And so, that's really all that I wanted to do.

251
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:15,993
Let me do this, though.

252
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:17,791
Let me save this and now let me run it.

253
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:21,399
I'd like to see if the splash screen pops up.

254
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:29,502
All right, and you saw the splash screen briefly there.

255
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,777
That's really cool.

256
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:34,854
Looks like I'm going to need to also add a little space there.

257
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,500
I forgot about, let me do that real quick

258
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,719
before we conclude this video.

259
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,285
And if you recall, I said this several times

260
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,825
how I wanted to put a Margin around this thing,

261
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:51,825
maybe: "0,5,10,0".

262
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:56,211
Now let's run it one more time.

263
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:58,131
There's our cool splash screen,

264
00:12:58,132 --> 00:13:01,843
and that looks pretty nice, okay.

265
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:04,517
Alright, so ideally we would test this a little bit more,

266
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:08,259
maybe run it on some friends' computers,

267
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,479
other devices, test with the various mobile emulators

268
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,829
that are available.

269
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,704
But I'm going to wing it

270
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,240
and I'm actually going to try and submit this

271
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,834
in the next video to the Store, so we'll see you there.

272
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:19,443
Thanks.
