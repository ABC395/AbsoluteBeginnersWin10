1
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:06,480
<v ->Alright, so next step, we're going to think about ways</v>

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:07,842
that we can monetize our app,

3
00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:09,862
and there's two obvious ways to do this,

4
00:00:09,863 --> 00:00:13,922
very low-friction ways to get our app into people's hands

5
00:00:13,923 --> 00:00:15,702
and make money every time that they use it

6
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:17,142
even if they don't pay for it,

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:18,262
but then also for those people

8
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,462
that really hate advertisements,

9
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:22,722
we're going to allow them to upgrade to a "pro" version,

10
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,562
(chuckles) I guess you could say, and remove the ads.

11
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:29,134
In order to get started with this, take a look

12
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:32,234
at this URL that you see on screen right now.

13
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:36,044
That'll take you to the,

14
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:39,126
let's see here, to this page,

15
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:42,716
where you can learn more about how to add

16
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:45,861
ads in your apps, and you can get the SDK

17
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:49,722
for Windows 10, it also works for the other versions, too,

18
00:00:49,723 --> 00:00:52,682
but we're basically just going to click Install the SDK,

19
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:55,162
that'll take us to the Visual Studio Gallery

20
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:59,542
where we can download the Windows Ad Mediation Extension.

21
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:02,142
Now I've already downloaded this onto my desktop,

22
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:04,302
and you can see it right here.

23
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:06,902
And the first thing you should do before running this

24
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:11,562
is actually close down all of your Visual Studio instances,

25
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,582
then run this, and then you can open up Visual Studio again.

26
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,335
Because it is an extension to Visual Studio.

27
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:18,835
So I've already gone through that.

28
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:22,015
It's a very simple, just a normal Windows installer,

29
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,601
nothing really all that fancy there.

30
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:24,561
I'm not going to walk through it.

31
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:26,773
It's pretty simple, not a lot of options.

32
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:30,533
And then I'm going to create, just to demonstrate

33
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:32,513
how it works, I'm going to create

34
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,033
a new project called AdExample.

35
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,473
I've done absolutely nothing to this.

36
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:38,884
So I'm going to go ahead and remove the frame counter,

37
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:41,854
cause I like to get rid of that, as you know,

38
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,734
and the first thing that I'm going to do, and let me

39
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,214
pull this way over to the side here so you can see this.

40
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:48,634
I'm going to right-click on the project,

41
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:53,024
and, unfortunately, it pops up off the top of the screen.

42
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,165
But I'm going to select Add, Connected Service.

43
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:01,505
Here, let me see if I can get this.

44
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:03,780
Let me try to pull this off

45
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:06,550
right around here, and right-click.

46
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,630
Pull it down here.

47
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:15,090
Right-click, select Add, Connected Service, like so.

48
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,214
And you should see the Ad Mediator

49
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:20,014
in this list of Connected Services.

50
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,974
If you don't, then try shutting down Visual Studio,

51
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:27,194
re-opening, try re-booting, try re-installing

52
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:29,434
that MSI that you just downloaded.

53
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:32,344
I'm going to go ahead and click Configure, and

54
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,880
it says "this extension enables plug and play

55
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,060
"of third-party ad network solutions."

56
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:38,301
We can Select ad networks.

57
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:40,621
We only have one set up for ourselves.

58
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:43,272
We'll talk about ad networks in just a little bit.

59
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:47,474
If you click OK you're going to get this little message

60
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:49,934
that you couldn't add all the required references,

61
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,134
that's just fine, let's not worry about that.

62
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:54,735
But I am going to hit the Add

63
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,855
and there won't be a lot that happens

64
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,435
that you can see in the project,

65
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:02,395
but I'll show you what really does happen here

66
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:05,925
in just a moment as we move this back.

67
00:03:08,116 --> 00:03:11,435
What we really accomplished with that was

68
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:14,185
whenever we open up the MainPage.xaml,

69
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,535
and then we go, once the designer loads,

70
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:20,275
we go to the Toolbox, you'll see

71
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:23,495
that there are two new sections in the Toolbox,

72
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,595
one called AdMediator, and then AdMediator Universal.

73
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:29,195
This is the one that you want, just forget the first one.

74
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:31,695
You want the one with the Universal name.

75
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:33,915
And there's an AdMediatorControl

76
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:37,035
in that section called AdMediator Universal.

77
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:39,575
You're going to drag and drop that onto your designer surface.

78
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:42,717
You have to drag and drop onto the designer surface,

79
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:45,578
not directly into your XAML like I've done in the past.

80
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,338
You'll get this message that this reference

81
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,299
has been added to the project.

82
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,319
"In order to use types from this new reference,

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,519
"press OK to restart the XAML Designer,"

84
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,020
then "re-create the control on the artboard."

85
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,540
So we'll do that, and then I'm going to

86
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,071
go ahead and click Build Solution,

87
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:03,711
make sure it still builds.

88
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,201
Alright, and it does.

89
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,821
And now I'm going to go back to the Toolbox

90
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:14,861
and I'm going to re-add that same AdMediatorControl

91
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:18,241
by dragging and dropping it from the AdMediator Universal

92
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:21,721
section of the Toolbox onto my designer surface.

93
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:24,141
And this time you'll see that it adds

94
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:27,061
a couple of things here, let me go ahead and go up here.

95
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:30,161
It adds a new namespace, and it adds a control

96
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:32,001
that accesses that namespace.

97
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:34,221
And let me go ahead and just separate these

98
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,143
on individual lines here.

99
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,733
Alright, there we go.

100
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:45,653
So what we have is a control with a special name,

101
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,695
undoubtedly the name of your control

102
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:49,375
will be different than mine.

103
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,845
You're going to have an ID and undoubtedly

104
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:53,805
this ID will be different than mine, as well.

105
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,725
These are just randomly generated,

106
00:04:55,726 --> 00:04:59,885
and these are going to be just for development purposes anyway.

107
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:03,045
When you go and register your app with the store,

108
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:04,425
as we'll show in just a moment,

109
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:07,805
you're going to get a permanent one and it will

110
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,705
actually replace all of this for you,

111
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,925
you won't have to worry about that process.

112
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:15,712
Now that we've done that, let's go ahead and

113
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:18,532
go back to what we did before by right-clicking

114
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:21,792
and selecting Add, Connected Service,

115
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:23,129
you could see it barely off in the

116
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,729
upper right-hand corner when I did that.

117
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,109
So we're back to the screen, and we're going to click

118
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,647
Configure this time, and you'll see this message that

119
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:34,423
"your project changed and AdMediator.config will be updated.

120
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:38,483
"For more information, see the ad mediation documentation."

121
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:42,343
And it shows what will be added to that

122
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:45,360
AdMediator.config file, that's great.

123
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:48,448
Now you should see references are fetched,

124
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,158
and you can click Add to that,

125
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:54,028
and, again, I'm going to go ahead and build a solution.

126
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:55,898
You have to take those exact steps

127
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,748
or you're not going to get it to work,

128
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:00,468
I have found painfully as I have spent

129
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:03,034
more than a day working with this.

130
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:05,874
When I run the app, it takes a moment here,

131
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,634
but if I wait for a few seconds here, you'll see a little

132
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:11,234
placeholder ad for MSN pop up on my screen.

133
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,454
So I know that I did this right.

134
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,223
Very cool.

135
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:19,369
At this point, what I would need to do is to go into

136
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,379
go into my dashboard area and

137
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,544
if I haven't already done this, I'm going to need to create

138
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:30,424
a new entry for my new app.

139
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:33,854
And if you take a look at

140
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,336
the App overview for this new app,

141
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:39,386
you want to make sure to

142
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:46,876
go to Submissions, and you can see that

143
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:50,196
I'm currently in progress in a submission,

144
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:52,196
and one of the first things I'm going to need to do

145
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:55,956
is make a change to the App properties,

146
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,256
and I need to, at a minimum, give it the category

147
00:06:59,257 --> 00:07:01,076
and the subcategory, which I just selected

148
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:03,116
as Education, Instructional Tools.

149
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:04,736
It doesn't matter what you've chosen there.

150
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:07,656
But then save that, and now go back

151
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:10,016
to App overview, and if you scroll down,

152
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:12,715
you'll see something for Ad mediation,

153
00:07:12,716 --> 00:07:14,216
and you should be able to start

154
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,815
configuring ad mediation now.

155
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,036
And you can choose what ad networks

156
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,576
that you're going to serve up,

157
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:26,336
and you can even create Microsoft Advertising Ad Units,

158
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,926
which is something that you're going to need to do

159
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:32,791
at some point, whenever you go to submit your application.

160
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,071
As you can see, I've already created

161
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:37,550
one ad unit name and gotten an application ID.

162
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:41,111
It'll be a banner ad for the PC/Tablet.

163
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,911
And so this will be utilized

164
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:46,811
inside of the settings for my app.

165
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,532
Now let's talk about

166
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,861
the different types of ads that

167
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:54,402
we can create for our application.

168
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:57,362
If you take a look at that URL,

169
00:07:57,363 --> 00:08:01,761
that'll take you to a document in the Windows Dev Center

170
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,842
called "select and manage your ad networks."

171
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,862
And there's a bunch of ad networks

172
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:08,519
that are partially supported

173
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,719
by this ad SDK.

174
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,239
As you can see, the Windows Universal Platform,

175
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,203
they're still, the ad networks are still coming online.

176
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:21,823
It's mostly supported in some of the

177
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:24,328
oldest versions of the Windows Phone

178
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,400
and Windows 8.1,

179
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:32,990
but at any rate, you can decide to have multiple ad networks

180
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,440
and just iterate through

181
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,023
each of the ad networks that you want to use.

182
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,942
Now again, only Microsoft Advertising

183
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:41,222
is supported currently for the

184
00:08:41,223 --> 00:08:43,762
Universal Windows Platform version that we're using.

185
00:08:43,763 --> 00:08:46,182
But if you scroll down you can see that,

186
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:48,563
here are some more details about including

187
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:53,183
Microsoft Advertising network into your application,

188
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,403
and what's required, and how you get

189
00:08:55,404 --> 00:08:57,602
the Application ID and the Ad Unit ID

190
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,142
and what they're used for, and how you can then use them

191
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:04,382
inside of the Ad Mediation Control.

192
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:06,282
Then if you take a look at the navigation

193
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:10,734
on the left-hand side, it will give you another

194
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:13,824
article about adding and using the Ad Mediation Control,

195
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:16,665
what we dragged and dropped onto our designer surface,

196
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,885
and the different default settings that are added

197
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:23,867
and how you can configure them for

198
00:09:23,868 --> 00:09:27,067
each of the different ad networks,

199
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,418
and how you declare the capabilities

200
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:35,314
for a given network inside of the ad mediator,

201
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:39,634
or rather, the, yeah, the ad mediator that we saw

202
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:44,015
a little bit ago when we clicked on Add, Connected Services.

203
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,455
But I think, ultimately one of the most important things

204
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:49,795
from this page that is a takeaway is that

205
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:52,355
these are the different ad sizes that are supported

206
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:54,635
for the Universal Windows Platform.

207
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,275
And so most of these are going to be square

208
00:09:57,276 --> 00:10:01,175
or like a three by four sized orientation,

209
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:03,697
I guess you can say, or four by three, rather,

210
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:07,297
but this one, this long, skinny one, would be the one

211
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:09,437
that I would probably use for our project,

212
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:12,637
because it's 728 pixels wide but 90 tall.

213
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:17,537
So it'd fit really nice along the bottom of our application.

214
00:10:17,538 --> 00:10:18,982
So we're going to remember that.

215
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,762
In fact, I'm going to open up Notepad here

216
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:25,602
and type in 728 and 90, cause I'm going to remember that.

217
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:30,792
Alright, but ultimately, whenever you submit your app

218
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:35,753
to the app store, it will replace several of the

219
00:10:36,964 --> 00:10:39,704
settings that were created here by default,

220
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,104
like in this AdMediator.config file.

221
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:44,545
So generally you shouldn't have to mess with this

222
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:45,525
if you were to configure

223
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:47,696
everything correctly in the dashboard.

224
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,306
So, any rate, now that we know how to create a ad,

225
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,066
let's go ahead and get back into our project

226
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,946
and make sure that we add that in.

227
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,366
So here we are, back in the AlbumCoverMatchGame.

228
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,846
And what I want to do is go to the MainPage.xaml,

229
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:06,706
specifically I want to go and I'm going to add

230
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,906
one more row definition at the bottom,

231
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,467
and it's only going to be 90 tall,

232
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,177
and that's where we're going to put the ad.

233
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:19,001
We'll put it, then, here, we'll drag and drop it

234
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,951
onto the design surface in just a moment.

235
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,112
I'm going to right-click my project name and select,

236
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,432
and you unfortunately can't see this

237
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:29,232
off to the top of the screen, Add, Connected Service,

238
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,914
and the Ad Mediatior, I'm going to select Configure,

239
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,135
I'm going to select the ad networks,

240
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:36,774
Microsoft Advertising is my only choice,

241
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:38,593
I'm going to click Add.

242
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:43,234
Now what I want to do is go to MainPage.xaml

243
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,861
and I want to view the design view for this,

244
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:52,071
and I'm going to try and find that bottom area,

245
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:54,241
hopefully I can drag into it.

246
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,391
I'm going to go to the Toolbox, go to the AdMediator Universal

247
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:02,071
section of the Toolbox and drag the AdMediatorControl

248
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:06,451
into what I hope to be that third row,

249
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,211
but I can fix that if it doesn't go there perfectly.

250
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,731
I'm going to get that message box that

251
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,251
the reference has been to the project,

252
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:17,359
I'm going to click OK, I'm going to click Build the Solution,

253
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,619
great, and now I'm going to go back and attempt to

254
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,646
go to the Toolbox and re-drag and drop

255
00:12:29,647 --> 00:12:33,086
the AdMediatorControl into that bottom area there.

256
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,786
Now, admittedly, you can see that

257
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,105
it's kind of fighting me, but that's fine.

258
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,026
At this point I have everything in there that I need

259
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,574
and I go back to the XAML view

260
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,534
and actually make the changes to it that I need to make.

261
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:53,619
Here we go, Grid.Row equals 2 is what we needed,

262
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,367
perfect, it put that in there.

263
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm going to go ahead and get rid of the margins here.

264
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,881
I'm also going to change the height of this

265
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:03,701
to 90 and the width to 728,

266
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,709
remember that was one of the ad sizes.

267
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,077
Let's get rid of everything there

268
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,525
and let's get rid of everything here.

269
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:14,705
Let's build it one more time just to be on the safe side.

270
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,645
And I'm going to run the app

271
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:24,241
and with any luck, after a moment we'll see

272
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,940
at least a sliver of that little MSN

273
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:32,201
advertisement popup.

274
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:36,960
(guitar music)It's not popping up for me.

275
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:41,619
That could be a size issue, so let me

276
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,195
back out of this change,

277
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:47,915
I'm just going to hit "ctrl + z" and "ctrl + z".

278
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:51,694
Oh, you know what, I did forget a step.

279
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:53,283
I forgot a step.

280
00:13:53,284 --> 00:13:58,003
After I added everything, I need to go back now,

281
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:02,563
and go back to Add, Connected Service,

282
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:05,423
go back to the ad mediator, Configure,

283
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:08,783
click OK, and click Add.

284
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:10,056
Now I should be able to build,

285
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,670
I knew I was forgetting something.

286
00:14:13,258 --> 00:14:17,474
And now I'm going to change the height to 90

287
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:20,432
and then the width to 728.

288
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:21,933
That should fix that.

289
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,204
And let's go ahead and build the solution

290
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:29,180
one more time, cause I'm paranoid about this.

291
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:30,980
(laughs) Clearly.

292
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:32,651
And let's run the app.

293
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:35,908
And hopefully we'll see the little sliver of blue down here.

294
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,179
And we do. Great.

295
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,298
So it's there.

296
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,299
And if I click on it, it opens up to MSN.

297
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,358
Perfect.

298
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,284
(guitar music)So that's how we can add

299
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,244
Microsoft Advertising (chuckles)

300
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,794
Microsoft Advertising to our app.

301
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:53,344
Now hold on a second, I just noticed

302
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:55,143
something that did not look very cool.

303
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,474
Let me make sure this is all running correctly.

304
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:10,153
I seem to have lost my(guitar music)

305
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,684
lost something here in the process.

306
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:17,037
I've introduced a bug somehow,

307
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:21,117
hoping it's a small fix, but let me look into that as well

308
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:23,478
by adding the Mediator Control,

309
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,217
seems like I lost all my album art.

310
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:26,837
So let me look into that

311
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,467
and we'll start back up in the next video.
