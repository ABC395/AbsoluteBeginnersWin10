1
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:08,689
The goal of this lesson isto display details about      

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,180
the character that was selectedin the master list view.      

3
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:18,880
We want to displaythe characters larger      

4
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:22,790
version of the thumbnail image,their name, a description.      

5
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,990
And then, eventually we'lldisplay, in the next video,      

6
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:29,196
all the comic books relatedto that particular character.      

7
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,930
At least the mostrecent comic books.      

8
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,490
Now, there's also another thingthat I wanna address in this      

9
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:35,610
lesson, and      

10
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:40,509
that is, sometimes you're onlygonna get back a small number of      

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,720
characters that satisfy theconditions that we have here.      

12
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:47,650
Many of them don'thave thumbnails.      

13
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:50,850
We might get an errorwhenever we're making a call      

14
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,820
into a resourceacross the Internet.      

15
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,570
The Marvel comics APIservers could have an issue.      

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,310
The JSON that comesback is botched or      

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,540
isn't quite formed correctly.      

18
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:08,150
The JSON that does come backwhen we try to do that step      

19
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,690
that I'm always nervousabout whenever we      

20
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:14,850
deserialize that JSONinto our object graph.      

21
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,240
That could go bad.      

22
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:19,790
So, I need a strategy for      

23
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:24,460
recovering whenever ourapplication simply can't      

24
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:27,730
get on the first tryeverything it needs.      

25
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:28,982
So, we'll address that as well.      

26
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:30,386
But let's start offwith the simple stuff.      

27
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:34,620
I'm gonna go over hereto the mainpage.xaml.      

28
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:40,730
And what I want to dois flesh out the grid.      

29
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:43,154
The details grid orthe grid detail.      

30
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:47,218
The detail grid.      

31
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,531
All right,let me get into code mode here,      

32
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:55,424
and what we're gonna wanna dois create some RowDefinitions.      

33
00:01:58,687 --> 00:02:06,900
And there's gonna bethree distinct areas.      

34
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:10,800
The top row, will be      

35
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,076
where we display the detailsof the character.      

36
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:21,312
The second row, will be where wedisplay the list of comics that      

37
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:24,270
character has been in recently,and then finally,      

38
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,980
as you click on one ofthose comics, we'll display      

39
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:32,120
the details about a givencomic in the third row, okay?      

40
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,130
The next thing we'regonna wanna do,      

41
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:37,310
is now that we have ourrow definitions created,      

42
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:39,960
we're gonna focus on thatfirst row definition, so      

43
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,390
we're gonna create anothergrid inside of it.      

44
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:45,968
So, just to make sure weremember what we're doing here,      

45
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,283
grid.row = 0, and      

46
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:51,096
I'm gonna make sure to set thehorizontal alignment to left.      

47
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,845
Most of these shouldbe defaults but      

48
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,776
I'm just not takingany chances here.      

49
00:02:58,117 --> 00:03:02,843
And then, inside of that gridI'm gonna create one row      

50
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:07,528
that will display the Name and      

51
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:12,920
a second row, that willdisplay the description.      

52
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:14,080
And then, two columns,      

53
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:17,397
a left column that willdisplay the image and      

54
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:21,910
a right column that will displaythe name and the description.      

55
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,710
Okay, so two by two grid.      

56
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,027
So, row definitions, and      

57
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:31,240
we'll just set the heighton each of these to star.      

58
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,380
Give them equal width there.      

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,523
And we'll do the samewith column definitions.      

60
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:51,356
The first column,I'm gonna set to auto, And      

61
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,963
the second column widthI'm gonna set to star.      

62
00:03:54,964 --> 00:03:56,686
Now, all of this issubject to change, so      

63
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:58,972
this is just where I'm starting.      

64
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:02,240
All right, on the left sideI want the image to appear.      

65
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:07,705
So I'm gonna set thatimage Grid.Column = "0".      

66
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:12,310
But actually,I want it to span both rows.      

67
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:17,989
So, Grid.RowSpan="2".      

68
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,748
And then, we're gonna need to      

69
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:26,580
populate its valueprogrmatically.      

70
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,940
So, I'm gonna set the name ofthis equal to DetailImage.      

71
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,930
Next up, we're gonna havethe text block that will contain      

72
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:38,072
the name of the characters.      

73
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:40,150
So, DetailNameTextBlock.      

74
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:47,491
We're gonna setthe column equal to 1, so      

75
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:50,443
the second column,and I'm also gonna      

76
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:54,300
make the font size a littlebit larger than before.      

77
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,260
So, we'll set the fontsize at like 32.      

78
00:04:56,261 --> 00:05:00,511
And then finally, we'll createanother text block that will      

79
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:03,779
contain the description,if there is one, and      

80
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,577
just like the thumbnail,      

81
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:09,029
many of the characters donot have descriptions.      

82
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:15,420
So, that's fine, we just want todisplay it if there's not one.      

83
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:20,507
So, we're gonna set thatin Row="1" Grid.Column="1".      

84
00:05:20,508 --> 00:05:23,750
And I'm also gonna go ahead,while I'm thinking about this,      

85
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,600
and set the text wrapping.      

86
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:28,900
Because this mightbe a paragraph, so      

87
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,260
I'm gonna set the wrappingequal to wrap.      

88
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,156
Let me put these ona separate line, so      

89
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:35,759
you can see thema little bit easier.      

90
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:43,955
Great.      

91
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,034
All right.The next thing that I wanna do      

92
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,194
is go back to our list view,and I wanna make it,      

93
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:54,483
so that you can actuallyclick on one of the items.      

94
00:05:54,484 --> 00:06:00,345
So, IsItemClickEnabled="true".      

95
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:07,856
And then,ItemClick="NewEventHandler".      

96
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:13,342
I'm gonna go to thatnew event handler      

97
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:17,971
using F12 on my keyboard, and      

98
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:25,180
what we wanna do is to getthe selected character.      

99
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,710
So, the item click event argswill actually give us the item      

100
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:33,910
that was clicked, and that willbe an instance of character.      

101
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:37,937
It's just unfortunatelysaved as an object.      

102
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:44,936
So, we're gonna have toa casting back to character.      

103
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,872
So, var selectedCharacter =      

104
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,637
Then, I'm going topopulate the easy stuff.      

105
00:06:56,638 --> 00:07:03,702
DetailNameTextBlock.Text =selectedCharacter.name.      

106
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:05,978
And we'll do the same thing forthe description.      

107
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,794
Now, getting the image todisplay an image will be      

108
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,350
a little bit trickier.      

109
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:19,180
We're gonna have to createa bitmap image, and      

110
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:22,650
once we populate the bitmapimage's source, then,      

111
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,820
we can set it as the sourceof our XAML image control.      

112
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,760
So, this is how you do it.      

113
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:28,930
You might even wannasave this little snippet      

114
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:29,489
to your cheat sheet.      

115
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:40,918
Now, the bitmap image object,we're gonna have to add a using      

116
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,198
statement towindows.ui.xaml.media.imaging,      

117
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,949
like so.      

118
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,027
And we're gonna needto create a new URI.      

119
00:07:52,428 --> 00:08:02,428
And we're going to give itthe location by giving it selectedCharacter.thumbnail.la-      

120
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:04,966
rge.      

121
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:08,680
And then, we're gonna giveit the URI kind of absolute.      

122
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:11,130
Cuz it's gonna be a URL.      

123
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,000
All right, it doesn't like,oh I didn't spell it correctly.      

124
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:16,500
There we go.      

125
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,898
All right, so      

126
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:25,830
largeImage.uri.UriSource = uri,obviously.      

127
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:28,720
And now, it should haveeverything it needs to be a real      

128
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,530
bitmap image.      

129
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:38,141
And so, we can do thisDetailImage.Source = largeImage.      

130
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,071
That should work.      

131
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:42,820
Let's go ahead and try it.      

132
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,070
Okay, so this is an errorI run into occasionally.      

133
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,056
I'm not exactlysure what happens.      

134
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,694
In this case,I believe this to be      

135
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:03,290
an issue withthe deserialization process.      

136
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:08,428
This is one of thosethings I seek to resolve      

137
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:14,294
by adding some some code,in the very next step.      

138
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:15,397
And we hit thisa couple of times.      

139
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:22,431
All right, buteventually we get data.      

140
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:23,687
Okay, so now,      

141
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,140
this will kind of show whetherwe got this right or not.      

142
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm going to click onone of the items and      

143
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:32,840
you can see the image andthe name.      

144
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,360
The image and the name.      

145
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:40,187
The image and the name.      

146
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:43,805
Like I said, most of these itemsdon't have descriptions, but      

147
00:09:43,806 --> 00:09:45,949
Pete Wisdom doeshave a description,      

148
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,356
which is awesome for us,      

149
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:51,540
because now we can kind of workwith the spacing of things here.      

150
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,340
If you take a look.      

151
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:57,220
First of all,I gave each of these rows equal      

152
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,040
space by giving them both starbut I think I'm just gonna make      

153
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:04,510
this top row auto, andthe bottom row, star or auto.      

154
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:06,230
Probably, star.      

155
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:06,730
And then,      

156
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm gonna add some marginsaround the size of this guy.      

157
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,590
I'm actually gonnapush everything off      

158
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,550
about 10 pixels there.      

159
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,490
Okay.      

160
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,140
So, we've got a littlebit of work to do.      

161
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:22,792
I'll push that up, or that downa little bit as well, okay.      

162
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:28,132
So let's get started in here,in the MainPage.xaml.      

163
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:31,223
I'm gonna go to the DetailImage,and      

164
00:10:31,224 --> 00:10:35,481
I'm gonna set its verticalalignment equal to top.      

165
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:39,320
I think that have might havebeen the issue with that.      

166
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:43,146
I'm gonna go to the grid,actually, I think what I'll do,      

167
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:45,398
is go to the entire detail grid,and      

168
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,791
I'm gonna add a margin thereon the left-hand side.      

169
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:54,816
So, margin 10, 0, 0, 0.      

170
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:57,716
Actually, I might add 10 fromthe right as well just to      

171
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:00,690
make sure that nothing bumpsup against the right there.      

172
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:06,815
All right,the next thing I wanna do,      

173
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:10,466
is in this inner gridI want to set the.      

174
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,690
RowDefinition ofthe top row to Auto.      

175
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:20,740
That should fix that issue.      

176
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,176
And then,I also want to set the margin      

177
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:32,447
to the right ofthe text to maybe 10.      

178
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:38,102
And the same would be true then,for the other text block.      

179
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:49,019
So now I'm going to runthe application again, and      

180
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,484
I'm going to keep refreshinguntil I find a character that      

181
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:54,865
has a description      

182
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:05,590
Okay.      

183
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,960
So, I'm very happywith the results.      

184
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,480
Still, wish that the textwas up a little bit higher.      

185
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,510
I guess it's finethe way that it is.      

186
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:18,392
We'll just go ahead andgo with that for now.      

187
00:12:18,393 --> 00:12:19,070
But do you notice,      

188
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,830
we only got three itemson that particularly try?      

189
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:26,730
So, that leads me to somethingI wanted to talk about here.      

190
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,370
Which is,      

191
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:34,090
making the call into thisPopulateMarvelCharactersAsync,      

192
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:39,060
it just might not returnas many items as we want.      

193
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,280
So, I want at least ten itemsin the list, maybe more.      

194
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:49,837
So, what I'm gonna do is adda while condition here so,      

195
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:54,450
here let's do this again,while Tab Tab, and      

196
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,580
what we'll check for      

197
00:12:56,581 --> 00:13:01,807
is the number of itemsinside of marvel characters.      

198
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:06,509
So, MarvelCharacters.Count.      

199
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,402
While it's less than 10 items,      

200
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:13,800
then we're gonna continueto go through this loop.      

201
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,785
And inside of herewe're gonna call await MarvelFacade.PopulateMarvelChar-      

202
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:23,084
actersAsync.      

203
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:27,193
Now, the challenge here, is thatan asynch method might take      

204
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:31,224
awhile to return, so we couldbe looping here a billion times      

205
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:35,100
while this is still tryingto run the very first time.      

206
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:40,150
So, it could be a lot ofcalls out to that method.      

207
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,150
That's just the waythat this works.      

208
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,950
It works as a promise, and then,      

209
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,610
it continues on withthe next line of code.      

210
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:49,920
But that promise may not comeback to us before we actually do      

211
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:53,250
an evaluation on the currentcount of Marvel Characters.      

212
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:58,930
So, to fix this, what I wantto do is make sure that PopulateMarvelCharactersAsynch      

213
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,460
returns a task.      

214
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,680
And then, we'll just checkthe task, or we'll just wait for      

215
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:08,510
the task, before we continueon with another run of      

216
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:12,290
our while statement, or check onthe while statement's condition.      

217
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,560
So, let's go tothe MarvelFacade, and      

218
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,940
take a look at whatwe return here.      

219
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,520
We do indeed return a task,so that's great news.      

220
00:14:17,521 --> 00:14:20,860
Let's go back tothe MainPage.xaml.cs.      

221
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,770
And instead of usingthis await statement,      

222
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:27,180
I'm just gonna say, hey,give me a task of T.      

223
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:28,950
Woops.      

224
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,150
Task of T, I'm going toneed to add the task      

225
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:39,418
by adding a using statement tosystem.threading.tasks, and now,      

226
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,020
we should see it.      

227
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:42,780
Great, and then,we'll just do this.      

228
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,140
await t.      

229
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,970
So, this will force us to waitfor the first call to finish      

230
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:56,060
before it loops back, and doesthe conditional check, right?      

231
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,862
So, let's go ahead andrun the application.      

232
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:13,551
One, two, three, four,five, six, seven.      

233
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:17,985
And now, I'm waiting for it,it's still going, notice that.      

234
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:23,360
And now, we have eight, nine,ten, and a bunch more, okay.      

235
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:27,823
And then,there's one last thing that I      

236
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:31,628
wanna do cuz thiscould still die,      

237
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:37,023
if we're not doing thisjust right, so let's,      

238
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:42,909
I wanna wrap try-catches aroundany code that's gonna make      

239
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,570
a call out to a dependencythat I cannot control.      

240
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,890
In this case, I can't controlthis call out to Marvel.      

241
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,460
A bunch of differentthings could go wrong.      

242
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,220
So, in that case,      

243
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,110
I'm going to wrap the try-catcharound this line specifically.      

244
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:59,560
Now unfortunately,you can see that when I do that,      

245
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm going to out of scope withsome other things here so.      

246
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:08,320
What I'll just do is justgrab everything else,      

247
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:10,500
just to make thiseasy on myself.      

248
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:13,270
You shouldn't haveto do this always.      

249
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:15,970
Really, the only thing youneed to wrap the try-catch      

250
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:17,750
around is for this line.      

251
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:19,940
But since everything elsebelow it depends on it,      

252
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:22,740
we'll just do that.      

253
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,430
So, essentially,      

254
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:26,400
what we're doing here isswallowing the exception.      

255
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,220
We're saying,if there's a problem, so      

256
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,690
let's just ignorethe problem and go on,      

257
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:35,080
which means that we'll return tand we'll try to evaluate and      

258
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:39,360
say, oh we still don't havemore than ten or ten or      

259
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:41,940
more items that means we'regonna try calling it again, and      

260
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:45,410
we'll just keep tryinguntil it can't try anymore.      

261
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:48,651
Maybe I should add a counter andsay after ten attempts maybe we      

262
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:51,340
should just give it up butI won't do that just yet.      

263
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,060
So let's watch as thesethings filter in.      

264
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:04,191
Okay, so we've got one,two, three, four, five.      

265
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,840
And then we got more.      

266
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:08,700
Okay, so you can see that itmade two calls because it      

267
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:12,840
started off with the Bs andit went off to the Fs okay.      

268
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:15,887
And let's just make sure thateverything is still getting      

269
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,073
returned correctly.      

270
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:28,630
I just wanna see an itemthat has a description.      

271
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,790
Unfortunately, none of theseitems have descriptions.      

272
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,180
All right, well that's okay.      

273
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm pretty sure it works.      

274
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:39,000
So we're gonna stop right hereand we're gonna move on and      

275
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:43,700
we're gonna display a list ofcomics for every item, for      

276
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:45,770
the character that was selected.      

277
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:46,790
So we'll do that next.      

278
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:47,430
We'll see you there.      

279
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:47,930
Thanks.
