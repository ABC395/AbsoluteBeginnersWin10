1
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:11,118
All right so I think we'repretty much done here except for      

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,238
one little piece offunctionality that I wanted      

3
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:19,470
to implement andthat was the auto complete box.      

4
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,110
Where are you?      

5
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:23,496
AutoSuggestBox, okay.      

6
00:00:23,497 --> 00:00:28,020
And I wanted to beable to do searches and      

7
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,750
then also, when somebody submitsthe actual search it would      

8
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:36,890
perform the query andrefine down the items      

9
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:40,180
in the results to just thosethat match the other criteria.      

10
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,710
So really just the name.      

11
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:46,280
All right so to implementthis we have two methods, or      

12
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:50,155
two events, to handle the textchange and the query submitted.      

13
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:52,715
So let's go ahead andget started in there.      

14
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:56,705
And what we're gonnaneed is another,      

15
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:59,335
let's stick a nullhere between these two.      

16
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:04,937
Another, I think this time it'sgonna be a list of string called      

17
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:09,509
suggestions And      

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,531
I'll populate the suggestions      

19
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:21,977
with whatever we get back from,so let's see.      

20
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:31,059
So what we're gonna dohere is actually just set      

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,740
suggestions =SoundManager.GetAllSounds.      

22
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,980
I see that it's not reallyimplemented quite that way.      

23
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,540
So what I'll need to do here      

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,400
is actually change up how Iwas thinking about doing this.      

25
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,490
Let's GetAllSounds and      

26
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,870
let's pass in justSounds like that, right.      

27
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,709
And then we'll go Suggestions =      

28
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:05,092
Sounds.Where(p =>      

29
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:13,310
p.Name.StartsWith) and      

30
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,310
then whatever theyhave passed in.      

31
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:20,140
So I think at thispoint we can get      

32
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:25,114
text that has been typedin from sender.Text.      

33
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:29,100
All right, so once we have this,all we really want is      

34
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,970
just the name itself,not the entire sound object.      

35
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:37,857
So I'm just gonna projectout just the name      

36
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,310
property like that.      

37
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:45,860
And it doesn't like somethingthat I've done here.      

38
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:48,484
And I think I know why.      

39
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:52,663
So let me change this,I can do this one of two ways.      

40
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:57,980
I can keep list and just go,I think to list here.      

41
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:04,579
Yeah, to list, or I could justchange this to I numerable      

42
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,640
instead of list, right.      

43
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,240
But we'll just do it this way.      

44
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:15,371
So now that I have suggestions,I'm gonna set the. The      

45
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:22,041
SearchAutoSuggestBox.ItemSource      

46
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:25,169
= Suggestions.      

47
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:36,605
All right, yeah, this will work.      

48
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:44,333
All right, so now that we'vetyped in the word and I've hit      

49
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:48,720
entered on my keyboard, I needto handle the query submitted.      

50
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,170
So this will allow us      

51
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,660
to actually filter the itemsthat we're binding to.      

52
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:03,641
So that list of suggestionsshould be filtered all the way      

53
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:04,689
down, so.      

54
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:12,035
And so,what I think I wanna do here      

55
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:16,644
is make another method on sound      

56
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:21,430
manager to do some public static      

57
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:26,070
void getsoundsByName maybe.      

58
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,210
And then just type in a stringname, something like that.      

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,410
We can do almost everythingthat we've done before.      

60
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:40,911
And then we'll gear upa filtered set of sounds.      

61
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:51,414
Where(p => p.Name      

62
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:59,451
== name).ToList().      

63
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,064
And then, I guess whatI probably should do      

64
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:10,480
is Do an observable collection.      

65
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:16,120
So, ObservableCollectionSound,sounds.      

66
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:20,500
I know this isn't pretty,but sometimes when you're in      

67
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,090
development you have to thinkthrough things on the fly here.      

68
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:28,523
So, I guess the last stepwould be then to go filter      

69
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:32,758
sounds.do that whole foreach thing, right.      

70
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,130
PP null sounds.add p, right.      

71
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:40,010
See if that works.      

72
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:44,798
So then,back here in MainPage.xaml.cs.      

73
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:50,666
I'm gonna callSoundManager.GetSoundsByName and      

74
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:54,053
I'm gonna pass in Sounds, and      

75
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:58,868
then the sender.Text should      

76
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:03,331
give me what was typed intothat auto suggest box.      

77
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:08,892
And I think that'sall I need to do.      

78
00:06:12,897 --> 00:06:17,749
Yeah, I might do some ofthis stuff though here.      

79
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,380
So I'm gonna set all soundsto whatever sender.Text is.      

80
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,545
MenuItemsListView.SelectedItem =null, that's correct.      

81
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:35,043
BackButton.Visibility shouldbe visible, like that.      

82
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:38,365
Okay, so let's see if this worksthe way that I had in mind.      

83
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:43,924
All right, so cat.      

84
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,939
It didn't filter the list.      

85
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,703
That's unfortunate.      

86
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,198
I'm gonna set a breakpoint there and      

87
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,362
figure out what I did wrong.      

88
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:58,180
Let's go, Cow.      

89
00:06:58,181 --> 00:06:59,956
All right, so let's step in.      

90
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:05,540
You know what I forgot to do?      

91
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,317
I forgot to take thatstep right there.      

92
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:08,741
I'll bet you,that's the problem.      

93
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:14,808
So let's add that like there,      

94
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,630
and then let's try this again.      

95
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:23,466
All right Cow, and I'm justgonna blow through it and      

96
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:24,668
see if it works.      

97
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:25,423
It does.      

98
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:28,616
[SOUND]I'm gonna hit back,      

99
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:29,483
I got all sounds.      

100
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:32,187
Let's go Gun.      

101
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:36,968
You know, the one thing Iwould like to do is clear      

102
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:40,478
out the box afterI'm done with it.      

103
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,763
Let me do that one thing.      

104
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:46,561
It's the query submitted.      

105
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:49,381
All right, sothen I should be able      

106
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:54,130
to go SearchAutoSuggestBox.Text= nothing.      

107
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,680
See if that works.      

108
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:56,893
I'm wanna get ridof the break point.      

109
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:02,878
Now ideally, before we move intothe next part of getting ready      

110
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,960
to submit,I would do a lot of testing.      

111
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:08,710
Test on physical devices,test on different desktops,      

112
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:10,170
just whoever I could get,to help me out here.      

113
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,400
Let's go Ship, Enter.      

114
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:19,020
See the problem here isthat the order of events,      

115
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:24,235
right, it will,by making that change,      

116
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:29,647
it will actually,      

117
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:33,970
it will rerun the querysubmitted a second time.      

118
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,740
So I can't put that in this lineof code, I can't put it there.      

119
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,738
What I can do however is maybeput it there when we hit      

120
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,080
the Back button or      

121
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:48,390
whenever we make a differentselection on the menu list.      

122
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:51,290
[SOUND] Let me putthat there as well.      

123
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,402
So those two spots,this is what happens.      

124
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:58,640
State management'susually tricky,      

125
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:01,890
you gotta think okay,what needs to be where and when.      

126
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,620
Also it looks like Ineed a little paddling      

127
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:05,840
on the right there ormargin on the right.      

128
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:06,770
Okay.      

129
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,379
Here we go.Cow.      

130
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,500
Got it.      

131
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,170
I use Back button.      

132
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,340
See I can see it flicker whichtells me that it's running it      

133
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:16,850
twice.      

134
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,860
I'm not sure with the rightanswer to this is.      

135
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,350
So watch the issue here.      

136
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,310
Okay, cat, good.      

137
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,787
Now when I click something else,      

138
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,475
you'll notice thatthere is a brief,      

139
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:35,008
it will display everythingthen there's a flicker, and      

140
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,557
then it will display everything.      

141
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:43,231
It goes [SOUND] beforeit hit taunts and      

142
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:48,536
it does even all taunts because,again, we've by setting the text      

143
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:53,290
like that we're actuallychanging the logic of the code.      

144
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:58,576
So I might just need to do this,like that and just forget it.      

145
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,308
There probably is a wayto suppress that event.      

146
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:09,301
And I tell you what, off cameraI'll try to figure out if I can      

147
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:10,731
figure out a way to fix that.      

148
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,467
So, if I were to hit x there,everything, but      

149
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,310
it doesn't change that either.      

150
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,230
So there's a couplea little issues surrounding      

151
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,640
this that I need to figure out.      

152
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,680
So I'm gonna stop right here,and      

153
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:26,010
I'm actually going to playaround with this a little      

154
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,870
bit more before we goto the next video and      

155
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:31,900
maybe fix some things about it,but overall it kind of works.      

156
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:32,940
Okay.      

157
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:35,960
