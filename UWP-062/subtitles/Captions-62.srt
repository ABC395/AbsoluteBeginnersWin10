1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,819
<v ->All right, just a handful of finishing touches</v>      

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,000
and then we're going to move on.      

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,589
Let me run the app real quick.      

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,549
There's two things I want to do.      

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,449
First of all, going to get rid of the button,      

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,889
going to make sure that everything is nice and centered,      

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,049
which it's not so we'll fix that.      

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,889
And I guess three things,      

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,049
I'm going to add some exception handling as well.      

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,949
So let's go to the MainPage.xaml.      

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,819
This will all be really just quick and easy honestly.      

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,809
There's a little TextBlock,      

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,129
I'm going to put that there.      

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,570
And let's quick change the font.      

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,019
FontSize equals,      

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,049
oh, I don't know, 36.      

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,583
That should be sufficient.      

18
00:00:47,383 --> 00:00:49,689
Foreground="white".      

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,639
That should look good.      

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,049
I might even break that up into multiple lines      

21
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,310
so let me see how that looks before I get too far here.      

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,740
We're going to get rid of the button      

23
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,849
and I think what      

24
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,110
we're going to do also is      

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,079
VerticalAlignment="Center".      

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,670
Let's see how that works.      

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,409
And then HorizontalAlignment="Center"      

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,140
on the image and the text.      

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,180
Then, on the MainPage.xaml,      

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,219
actually let's go back to MainPage.      

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,079
I'm going to go Page, add a load--      

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,232
Loaded event handler.      

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,239
And inside there, I'm going to take everything      

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,440
inside that click button and move it      

35
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,240
like so.      

36
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,969
And we'll have to add async keyword,      

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,829
like so.      

38
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,019
And we'll get rid of the Button_Click event.      

39
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,640
So this will just load up as soon as we load the app.      

40
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,919
All right, so let's take a look at the changes now      

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,089
and just make sure everything looks good.      

42
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,789
There are one or two more things I want to do though.      

43
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,260
Whoa, that's not what I had in mind whatsoever.      

44
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,089
Okay, all right, so clearly got one thing      

45
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,289
I need to do there.      

46
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,089
Let's wrap another StackPanel      

47
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,690
inside of that StackPanel.      

48
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,700
Okay, we got that going for us.      

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,419
And we're going to make the background      

50
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,370
of the outermost StackPanel pink.      

51
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,849
All right, why aren't you happy?      

52
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,370
Oh, that's why.      

53
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,200
Okay, all right, that's good.      

54
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,549
That should fix that problem.      

55
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,240
Let's see where we have ourselves now.      

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,119
Okay, ideally I'd put these on separate lines.      

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,849
Let's go ahead and do that.      

58
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,600
So there is the location, the temp, and the description.      

59
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,640
So let's do this.      

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,940
Location, actually let's go Temp,      

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,219
Description, and then Location.      

62
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:33,849
I like that better.      

63
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,689
Temp will be the largest.      

64
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,350
We'll put this at like, I don't know, 52.      

65
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,419
The Description, yeah, 36 is good there.      

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,549
And then the Location.      

67
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,170
We'll make that smaller, 24.      

68
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,200
All right, and so Temp, Description, Location.      

69
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,100
Where are we here? Yeah.      

70
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,670
TempTextBlock.Text =,      

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,940
Description, Text      

72
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,700
and LocationTextBlock.      

73
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,660
Great, okay, so let's grab the Location off,      

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,870
stick that there,      

75
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,170
grab the Temp off      

76
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,040
and we'll stick that here.      

77
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,940
And finally, we'll take this      

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,789
and, whoops, put that there      

79
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,940
and this, the Temp, here.      

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,409
Great and get rid of that.      

81
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,419
Okay, one other thing that I want to do.      

82
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,109
So structure exception handling,      

83
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,849
you always want to wrap any call with a      

84
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,149
try-catch statement any time you're calling out to something      

85
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,789
you don't control.      

86
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,590
So if it's something you control in your own source code,      

87
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,789
that is up to you.      

88
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,489
But if you're going to make a call to a network,      

89
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,619
to a database, to a web service,      

90
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,049
to something you do not control,      

91
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,640
to the file system, you want to wrap it with a try-catch.      

92
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,789
Typically you only want to wrap try-catch around      

93
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,689
those things not just entire blocks of code.      

94
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,389
So you want to be very deliberate and specific      

95
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,889
with what you're wrapping try-catches around.      

96
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,619
Typically.      

97
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,849
In this case, if we get an error in one spot,      

98
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,349
the whole thing is going to fall down like a house of cards.      

99
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,570
So in that case, what I'm going to do      

100
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,060
is just wrap the entire code passage      

101
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,440
with a try.      

102
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,780
Now I could be a little bit more      

103
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,319
careful with what gets wrapped and what gets reported      

104
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,349
but honestly I'm just going to do this.      

105
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,919
I'm going to take this and in that Location      

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,889
I'm just going to say,      

107
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,449
"Unable to get weather at this time."      

108
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,719
something like that.      

109
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,989
And so here's what I'm going to do.      

110
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,640
I'm going to set up a break point on the try statement      

111
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,649
and then when I hit that I'm going to force it go      

112
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,119
to that line just so I can see what it looks like by itself.      

113
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,819
All right, so let's right click and say      

114
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,960
Set as the Next Statement.      

115
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,040
All right, well, pooh, on me.      

116
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,149
All right, we'll force this issue.      

117
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,589
We'll go and do it like this instead.      

118
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,840
I just want to see what it looks like when we can't get...      

119
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,549
All right, let's do this.      

120
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,940
Let's get rid of that.      

121
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,549
I'm just going to comment everything out.      

122
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,449
I just want to see what this will look like      

123
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,900
with just that text in it.      

124
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,249
I probably need to add the wrapping.      

125
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,319
No, that should do it.      

126
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,889
Let's see what it looks like here      

127
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,740
whenever we see it in our phone.      

128
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,419
Yeah, I need to wrap a little bit there.      

129
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,370
All right, no problem.      

130
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,220
So we'll turn on wrapping,      

131
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,134
equals Wrap      

132
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,000
Do it again.      

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,289
Okay, it's not pretty.      

134
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,789
I could work a little bit more on this      

135
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,149
and make it look better but for my purposes right now,      

136
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,649
it's just fine.      

137
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,349
Now let me go ahead and take the gloves off      

138
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,300
and let me run it,      

139
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,500
the whole code on the phone emulator.      

140
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,700
Yes.      

141
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,570
All right, I'm surprised that this is not lower.      

142
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,270
Well, let me think about this one second here.      

143
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,170
Did we not set VerticalAlignment="Center"? Hmm.      

144
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,450
That surprises me a little bit.      

145
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,389
But honestly it's just fine the way that it is.      

146
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,250
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and stop right now.      

147
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,209
And again, if you wanted to go and improve this,      

148
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,519
let me give you one little assignment.      

149
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,419
I'm not going to show you how to solve this,      

150
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,319
but what would be great if, in addition to right now,      

151
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,719
the current weather conditions,      

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,759
you were able to see for the next seven days.      

153
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,019
You can get that through the open OpenWeatherMap API.      

154
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,519
And you've already got the icons, just make them smaller,      

155
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,219
just put them up for the next seven days.      

156
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,559
Figure out how to do that.      

157
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,259
That would be a nice little addition to this.      

158
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,100
You can improve some of the exception handling,      

159
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,489
maybe add some options to change the background color      

160
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,649
from hot pink to whatever you want it to be.      

161
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,119
So those were all things I'm just going to      

162
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,449
let you do on your own.      

163
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,619
Take this, run with it, it's yours.      

164
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,789
And now we're going to move on to the next one.      

165
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,109
All right, so great, we're doing awesome.      

166
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,049
We'll see you in the next lesson.      

167
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,100
Thanks.
