1
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:07,600
<v Voiceover>Okay, so as we get started,</v>

2
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:11,781
let's focus on creating the Project, copying the assets

3
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:15,269
and then focus the majority of our time

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,620
laying out our application.

5
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,396
We're going to take a slightly different layout approach

6
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:20,749
than we've taken before,

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,818
maybe use a couple different techniques as well.

8
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:26,274
So without any further ado let me turn off the webcam

9
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,985
so I can focus.

10
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,801
We're going to create New Project.

11
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:36,369
And I'm just going to call this UWPSoundBoard.

12
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,921
We'll do what we always do here,

13
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:49,509
we'll remove the Frame Counter completely.

14
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,952
And then what I'm going to do is add assets,

15
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,595
and there's a couple different types of Assets

16
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:57,907
for this project. You can download these

17
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:01,568
from the previous video or this video.

18
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:05,610
Look for the download associated with one of those videos.

19
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,231
Now you'll notice a pattern here,

20
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:09,759
that there are categories of Audio

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,388
and then Icons that belong with those Audio .wav files.

22
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,748
So each of those subfolders have two .wav files

23
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:26,644
and if we go back to the Images, they'll match.

24
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:31,343
Just with a .png extension instead of a .wav extension.

25
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:34,564
The next type of folder we have here are Icons.

26
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:39,564
These will be used in the SplitView in the Pane

27
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:45,047
where we display usually a ListView of options.

28
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,454
Each of those represent a category.

29
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,566
Finally, here's the PackageAppXManifest.

30
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:55,278
And these are logo icons,

31
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:59,662
icons that are used for splash screen. 

32
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:01,315
Things that are going to be required

33
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:05,789
as we submit our app to the Windows Store.

34
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:10,210
Okay, so unfortunately, the way that you copy these in,

35
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:14,018
not as easy as, personally, I would like.

36
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,375
You'll see that there's a little bit of a weirdness here.

37
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:20,599
So Audio has a subfolder and inside of there you have files.

38
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,130
So when you drag and drop, for example this,

39
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:26,828
into your Assets folder, you'll notice

40
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:30,167
that there's no subfolders in there

41
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:31,702
and there's supposed to be.

42
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:33,974
Huh, okay well I guess it didn't copy them in.

43
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:38,273
So you go to those subfolders and you drag and drop those

44
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,545
and it'll say, wait a second, they're already there.

45
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,294
Like, what? (laughs)

46
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,915
So let's go ahead and just hit Apply to all items.

47
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,846
Yes, and it'll stick them all in there.

48
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:47,307
So we should have four categories

49
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:50,581
with two .wav files per category in the Audio subfolder.

50
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:54,709
We'll take that same approach here in the Icons folder.

51
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,504
I'll just drag and drop that Icon folder,

52
00:02:57,505 --> 00:02:59,562
says it doesn't have anything in there.

53
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:02,325
We know better, it just didn't add them to the Project.

54
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:06,165
So let's go and grab, drag and drop, it'll say,

55
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:09,919
are you sure? We already have them in there. No you don't.

56
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,919
Add them. And we'll do this again for the images,

57
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:18,720
for each of the audio files.

58
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:23,402
No subfolders, but we know they're there.

59
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,414
We'll drag and drop, stick them in.

60
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,387
"Are you sure?" Yes, do it.

61
00:03:30,188 --> 00:03:32,816
Then finally let's go

62
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:37,019
to the PackageAppXManifest folder

63
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,872
that I created, and go through this little dance again.

64
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:50,565
Alright, so that's out of the way.

65
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:52,745
We'll come back and we'll use those a little bit later.

66
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:55,999
I'll go ahead and pull this out, there.

67
00:03:57,051 --> 00:04:00,154
Close up assets, and pop open MainPage.xaml.

68
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,692
So I'm going to take a slightly different layout approach

69
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:06,521
this time, we will have a Layout Grid

70
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:11,521
and that'll give us the topmost row,

71
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,465
which will contain a RelativePanel

72
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:18,105
with the HamburgerButton, back button, and the search,

73
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:21,810
whatever it is, the AutoSuggestBox.

74
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:26,552
And then in that second row, we'll put a SplitPanel.

75
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:28,946
So let's start that process.

76
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:35,040
So here we go, RowDefinitions, Grid.RowDefinitions.

77
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:41,735
RowDefinition Height="Auto".

78
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:45,058
And we've done this at least a dozen times already

79
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:47,964
so this shouldn't be too hard.

80
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,519
Here we're going to put a RelativePanel.

81
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,791
And this, again, will contain that top matter.

82
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,998
And then below that we'll put a SplitView.

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,134
That'll contain everything in the main body.

84
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:04,150
So in this RelativePanel, I'm going to want to put,

85
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,985
first of all, the HamburgerButton.

86
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:08,747
I'm going to add a back button

87
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:12,651
and then I'm going to add an AutoSuggestBox.

88
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:19,917
Let's just put RelativePanel.AlignRightWithPanel = "True".

89
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,191
Here I'm going to give this one a name

90
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:27,345
of HamburgerButton.

91
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,629
And then this one would be RelativePanel.AlignLeftWith...

92
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:50,314
I'm sorry, AlignRight of the HamburgerButton.

93
00:05:57,293 --> 00:06:02,292
And this one would be RelativePanelAlignLeftWithPanel.

94
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,878
That should be pretty much self-evident,

95
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,962
but I'll put it there anyway.

96
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:12,077
I'm going to add a Click Event here

97
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,596
because I know I'm going to need it.

98
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:17,244
Go ahead and space these guys out.

99
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,128
I also know I'm going to need to put

100
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:38,848
for example, FontFamily is going to be Segoe MDL2 Assets

101
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:43,892
and then the Content will be, let's see if I remember,

102
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,945
"&xE700;"

103
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:02,361
If I got that right from memory,

104
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:04,211
I will be impressed with myself.

105
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,678
Which just goes to show, I don't memorize this.

106
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,622
Most people don't memorize these obscure little things.

107
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:14,137
That's why you have a cheat sheet.

108
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:17,315
Or you have the cheat sheet called the Internet

109
00:07:17,316 --> 00:07:19,677
you can always reference.

110
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,226
Yep, I got it right. Wow, I'm impressed.

111
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:24,970
With myself. (laughs)

112
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:26,463
It's the little things, right?

113
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:29,663
Okay, so next up I need a name for this Button

114
00:07:29,664 --> 00:07:34,510
so let's give it the name of BackButton.

115
00:07:36,545 --> 00:07:39,538
That's necessary because I'm going to give it the

116
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,607
Click equals NewEventHandler.

117
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,527
Here again, I want FontFamily equals Segoe MDL2 Assets.

118
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:54,957
And then Content="&#xE"... something or other.

119
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,751
You know I got to the point where I decided

120
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:04,404
I'm going to put the Character Map right here

121
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:08,921
on my task bar. And I think this is the one I want.

122
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:14,825
There's a bunch of these back arrows that have various uses.

123
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:18,264
But I'll use this one, 0A6.

124
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:24,525
That should be sufficient. 0A6.

125
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,616
And then the AutoSuggestBox,

126
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:30,014
there's really not much I need to do here,

127
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:31,571
I would need to give it a Name though.

128
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:36,354
So let's give it the name of search AutoSuggestBox.

129
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,760
And I'm going to put PlaceholderText equal to

130
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:45,298
to "Search for sounds".

131
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,437
I know I want the Width to be 200

132
00:08:49,438 --> 00:08:52,402
from that previous exercise that we did together.

133
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:59,182
And I know the QueryIcon I want defined QueryIcon.

134
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:04,561
Then I know that I'm going to handle the TextChanged Event

135
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:07,904
because we're going to filter the list based on that.

136
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:13,772
I also know that I want the QuerySubmitted Event

137
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:16,550
to handle that one as well.

138
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,550
Everything else though, I'm going to leave for now.

139
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,421
We'll come back to that in a while

140
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:27,807
when we try to actually get that functionality working.

141
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:32,943
Let's see now, that's the RelativePanel.

142
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,831
Now we haven't touched the SplitView yet

143
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:38,697
so let's see what we have first before we move on here.

144
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,511
See if there's anything glaringly wrong

145
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,713
with anything I've done up to this point.

146
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,100
These look awfully small, I'll probably change the Height

147
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,892
and the Width of Buttons themselves

148
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,720
and then change the Font.

149
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:58,115
So I'm going to use Height and Width of 45

150
00:09:58,116 --> 00:10:01,245
like we did in the previous exercise for these Buttons.

151
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,653
So Height="45", Width="45"

152
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:10,141
I like that, that feels good to me.

153
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:16,213
And then also I want to set the FontSize="20".

154
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:25,325
Alright, so that should be good enough for now

155
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,366
with that RelativePanel area.

156
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:37,217
Okay great. Need some padding,

157
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:40,347
but we'll come back for that later.

158
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:45,921
Alright next up, SplitView. Let's give it a name

159
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:48,065
because we're going to have to reference it programatically.

160
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:52,005
So MySplitView, DisplayMode,

161
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:56,576
I know I want that to be CompactOverlay,

162
00:10:56,577 --> 00:11:01,576
I also know that I want the CompactPaneLength equal

163
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:08,202
to be 45, that would be the Width of the buttons

164
00:11:08,203 --> 00:11:10,783
that I have above it, so I like that.

165
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:15,783
Then the OpenPaneLength, I don't know, 150 should be fine

166
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:18,282
but let me just put 200 here.

167
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:21,300
I seem to remember it's going to be a little bit larger

168
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,740
for some reason

169
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:26,062
having gone through this once already.

170
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,950
So that's good, so we got that.

171
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:33,172
And now inside of this I need the SplitView.Pane

172
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:39,587
and I then need the SplitView.Content.

173
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,496
In the Pane, we're going to have a ListBox

174
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:46,771
like we've always had, or actually, I'm sorry.

175
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,469
I'm going to do things a little bit different this time.

176
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,720
I'll use a ListView this time.

177
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:55,250
I'm going to Bind to the items and just use Data Binding

178
00:11:55,251 --> 00:11:58,429
and Bind to a List that I'll create in the code behind

179
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,359
for the MainPage.xaml.

180
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,351
I guess I will work on that in this lesson.

181
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:13,565
Anyway, I know that we want the is ItemClickEnabled

182
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,217
equal true on this, I know I'm going

183
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:20,268
to handle the ItemClick event on this as well.

184
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:25,680
Probably should give it a name. Bummer.

185
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:31,166
So Name="MenuItemsListView".

186
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:38,703
And so, let me regenerate that.

187
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,935
And I know I need a Template, and I know I need a Source.

188
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:58,020
I'll come back to that in a minute.

189
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,556
Now, in this area, I'm actually going to add,

190
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:03,337
in the Content area I'm going to add a Grid

191
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,759
because I'm going to actually split this into two Rows.

192
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,966
There will be a top Row that'll contain

193
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,295
what's being displayed in the main area

194
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,934
and then below that I'll have the items

195
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:18,160
that will be displayed.

196
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:22,933
So I'm going to need some RowDefinitions.

197
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,685
So RowDefinitionHeight="Auto".

198
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,410
So I know, whoops, let's not get here in the wrong spot.

199
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,042
Okay, there we go.

200
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:48,058
In this top Row I'm going to add a StackPanel

201
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,781
and it's just going to contain TextBlock.

202
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:54,607
I don't even know that I need the StackPanel, honestly.

203
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:56,164
I could probably do without it, in fact,

204
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:59,038
I will do without it. Just get rid of it.

205
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:03,599
Let's just go straight with the TextBlock.

206
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,599
And we'll set Name="CategoryTextBlock".

207
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,811
Text="All Sounds".

208
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,646
That will be the default text in there.

209
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:20,195
I'm going to make this kind of like a header,

210
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:22,875
so we'll set the FontSize="24".

211
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,400
Okay. And then in the lower area I'll add the GridView

212
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,274
beneath that and that'll contain all of our items.

213
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:35,271
And we'll set that Grid.Row="1".

214
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,732
And I'll call this Name="SoundGridView".

215
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,274
Alright, this is really the key one we want to focus on.

216
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:56,333
We want to set the SelectionMode="None".

217
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,386
All I want someone to be able to do is click on a sound

218
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:01,842
and it play the sound, I don't need selection.

219
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:05,233
I do want to set the is ItemClickEnabled that goes true

220
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,463
because I do want it to be clickable.

221
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:12,011
So then the ItemClick Event should be handled.

222
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:18,235
Now I know I'm going to need an Item Source

223
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:21,849
and all that business and I'll come back to that.

224
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,278
So let's go GridView.ItemTemplate

225
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,832
and then set the DataTemplate

226
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:35,466
and then let's put an Image inside of there.

227
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:41,359
And I happen to know that the Height

228
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,482
and the Widths are kind of weird

229
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:45,423
because when gave the specifications

230
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:48,442
to the guy who was working on it,

231
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:50,650
I just gave some arbitrary number

232
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,932
based on a mock-up that I'd created.

233
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:59,982
As I look at my notes here, I see is it 101 Width.

234
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,998
And we'll have to set the Source on that as well,

235
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,001
we'll come back to that later

236
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:05,230
whenever we do the Data Binding

237
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,336
in the next lesson.

238
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:11,331
But there's one other interesting little thing

239
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:14,717
that I want to stick here as well in this area.

240
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:16,974
And that is the MediaElement.

241
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,787
The media element allows you to play sounds

242
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:20,835
and we'll become very familiar

243
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,947
with that two videos from now.

244
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,834
Let me go ahead and give it the Name MyMediaElement.

245
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:30,679
And I'm going to set a property called AutoPlay="True".

246
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,679
And that just says, whenever I give you a Source,

247
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:42,273
so Assets/Sounds/Cow, whatever,

248
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:43,649
just go ahead and play it,

249
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,687
I'm not going to programatically tell you

250
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,560
to start and stop playing, just play, auto play.

251
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:53,185
Alright, I think that's all that I'm going to do here

252
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,275
in this first video. We covered a lot of ground.

253
00:16:55,276 --> 00:16:58,721
There's a lot left to do.

254
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,896
But we'll come back and get them

255
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:02,592
on subsequent passes at this.

256
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:04,982
So at this point there's really not a lot to this app,

257
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,496
it's just kind of the shell

258
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:10,675
and we'll come back and we'll fill in a lot of this stuff.

259
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:13,594
Okay, pick it up in the next lesson, thanks.
