1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,129
<v ->Wow, can you believe that this</v>

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,509
is the 80th video, it's crazy!

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,369
This is the largest single video series

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,029
that I've ever created for Microsoft,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,529
and I don't know about you, but I am worn out.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,869
I hope you enjoyed it.

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,589
The fact that you got to this point means

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,829
that you're probably pretty good at sticking with things,

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,509
and that quality will serve you well,

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,989
because it takes time and patience

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,149
to create a successful app.

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,649
I mean, I created these tiny little apps in about an hour,

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,989
maybe an hour and a half.

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,669
However, you're going to likely spend a couple of days,

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,569
at a minimum, and maybe a couple of weeks,

16
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,989
really testing and tweaking

17
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,730
and asking beta testers for suggestions,

18
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,509
and making sure it's just polished,

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,609
and it's not going to throw an exception at any circumstance.

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,269
And you really want to do that,

21
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,549
to make sure that you get a great first impression

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,469
and good reviews in the Microsoft Store.

23
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,209
So if you stuck with me through all 80 videos,

24
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,549
then wow, you deserve some sort of medal of honor,

25
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,949
in addition to having a pretty good idea

26
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,769
of what you're doing and how to go about creating apps

27
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,729
using the Universal Windows Platform.

28
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,229
I wouldn't blame you if you never want

29
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,789
to see my face or hear my voice again.

30
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,109
But, if you do like me, and like this style of training,

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,289
then make sure you let Microsoft know.

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,649
There are Microsoft and Channel 9 forums

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,349
and Twitter accounts.

34
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,990
There are plenty of ways to tell Microsoft

35
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:27,669
what you think about this series.

36
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,189
Now, assuming that you just can't get enough of Bob,

37
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,349
--and I don't understand that,

38
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,769
but let's just go ahead and assume that's possible--

39
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,329
Then, I'd recommend that you check out

40
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,849
the other video series that I've created.

41
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,309
Search MicrosoftVirtualAcademy.com for my name,

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,929
or Channel9 for my name.

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,629
There are several free training series

44
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,289
out there that you might like,

45
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,369
including HTML5 and CSS3 for Absolute Beginners,

46
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,889
Javascript and jQuery for Absolute Beginners,

47
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,409
there's like a hundred Azure videos

48
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,669
across four different series that I've created.

49
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,009
And a bunch of others.

50
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,449
Maybe those would point you in the right direction

51
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,289
on those technologies, as well.

52
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,849
If you're looking for additional resources on top of that,

53
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,849
then I direct you once again to this series

54
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,529
that was created by Andy Wiggly and Shen Chauhan,

55
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,529
called the Developer's Guide to Windows 10.

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,179
And then, furthermore, there are,

57
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,269
I know there are tons of great videos

58
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,169
from the Build Conference in the Spring of 2015,

59
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,369
Those sessions are all available on Channel9,

60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,129
you might have to do a little peaking around,

61
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,249
but you can find them.

62
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,359
Also, one resource that I didn't tell you about,

63
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,369
and perhaps one of the best,

64
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,089
is available from the developer.windows.com site.

65
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,409
So go out to developer.windows.com site,

66
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,409
and then choose this link, "Design and UI."

67
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,369
This really helped me to start thinking

68
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,829
like a Windows 10 developer,

69
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,829
so I highly recommend the "Design UWP Apps" sections

70
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,209
in the Windows Dev Center.

71
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,549
Now, I hope you already have an app or two in mind

72
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,609
that you want to build,

73
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,049
and hopefully some of the things that you learn

74
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,069
in this series will help you get started.

75
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,609
Now, if you're looking for meaty code examples

76
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,749
that go way beyond what I was able

77
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,549
to demonstrate in this series,

78
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,509
then you'll definitely want to check out this link here.

79
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,529
That will take you to Github,

80
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,409
where there are several dozen samples

81
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,309
that were created by Microsoft.

82
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,489
And there's an exhaustive list here.

83
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,229
Just about any feature that you can possibly think of,

84
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,809
they've got an example of it.

85
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,550
And then, within those projects,

86
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:49,389
there are multiple examples of it there

87
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,759
of the very advanced concepts, so it's an awesome resource.

88
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,749
You know, I've been perusing the Microsoft Store a lot,

89
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,329
in the past few weeks, both just snooping around

90
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,189
and sometimes because I legitimately needed

91
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,029
to find the solution to some problem or some need that I had

92
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,609
There's a lot of low-hanging fruit

93
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,529
that needs somebody to pluck it off the opportunity tree,

94
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,469
I guess you could say.

95
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,209
In other words, I think that if you look around

96
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,249
and you think hard about the kind of apps

97
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,550
that are successful on other platforms,

98
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,449
then you take a look at the Windows store

99
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,829
and ask, "Of the apps that are available

100
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,269
"to do sort of the same thing,

101
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,609
"are there any features that they're missing?"

102
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,789
Think about how you can introduce apps

103
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,609
that work great on any Windows 10 device,

104
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,309
and the benefits to having the user of those apps

105
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,969
work across an ecosystem of Windows 10 devices.

106
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,990
Not just one specific, either desktop or phone, app.

107
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:45,069
Think about how you could add Cortana integration,

108
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,249
in order to enhance the experience.

109
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,509
Think about live tiles, and how you can use those,

110
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,489
periodically updating the content on those tiles,

111
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,749
in order to inform the user

112
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,899
without them having to explode the application open.

113
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,289
And just think about how you can

114
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,269
improve the user's experience.

115
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,629
In the end, you know, don't shoehorn features in

116
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,459
that you don't need, advocate for the user.

117
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,929
Make it simple, and then give them the tools

118
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,599
that they need to achieve the end result that they're after.

119
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:14,170
And keep in mind that you'll be

120
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:16,369
running a company, essentially.

121
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,529
At least, that's how it's going to look

122
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,509
to those who are actually using your apps.

123
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,729
So, you'll need to grow thick skin,

124
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,230
I'll tell you that from experience.

125
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,850
There are lots and lots of nice people out there,

126
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:28,590
who will give you great feedback

127
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,509
and will thank you for your work,

128
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,169
and then occasionally you're going to run into

129
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,570
someone who's a little grumpy, having a bad day, right?

130
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:38,150
And so, you'll want to respond politely to everybody,

131
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:40,330
even the people who are a little bit mean.

132
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,789
You want to fix the issues in your app,

133
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,649
and you want to get the issues fixed

134
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,040
and uploaded to the store.

135
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,651
So that the users can update

136
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:52,850
and get the benefit of those updates as quickly as possible.

137
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,771
From my experience, whenever I treat

138
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:58,430
a grumpy customer kindly, then they usually

139
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:01,511
become my greatest advocate and my greatest cheerleader.

140
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,650
So, I'd recommend that you do that, too,

141
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:05,210
Be mature about this.

142
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,831
And, kind of moving on from there,

143
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:10,370
as a famous motivational speaker was known to say,

144
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,950
"You can get what you want out of life

145
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:13,991
"if you help enough other people get what they want."

146
00:06:13,992 --> 00:06:15,230
And I truly believe that,

147
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,611
and I think that there's great opportunities

148
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:20,751
for you to find your niches, to find your customers,

149
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:23,871
and then deliver solutions that they're looking for.

150
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,751
Alright, before I close, let me put in

151
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,491
one more plug for my website.

152
00:06:28,492 --> 00:06:30,750
Let me show you the url here on screen,

153
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,751
http://www.LearnVisualStudio.NET

154
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:36,111
where I teach beginners the skills that they need

155
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,531
to get their first software development job

156
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,912
building Windows and Web Apps

157
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:42,971
for the world's best companies as quickly as possible.

158
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:45,671
There, you're going to find more comprehensive series

159
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,031
than what I've done on Channel 9

160
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,411
or Microsoft Virtual Academy.

161
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:53,891
On topics like C# and ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC,

162
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:56,331
application architecture, data access,

163
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,271
and just about everything you're going to need

164
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:00,852
to get an entry level software development job

165
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,891
at a major company.

166
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:06,252
So, once again, I want to sincerely thank Andy Wiggly.

167
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:08,111
I feel sorry for him, that he actually

168
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,591
had to watch all these videos and review them,

169
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:13,551
but he really, really helped me fit about,

170
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:16,871
I don't know, maybe six months or a year's worth of effort

171
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,791
into about six weeks.

172
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,871
So, thank you very much, Andy.

173
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,812
And again, Clint, thank you, sir.

174
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:24,411
Thanks to Larry Lieberman,

175
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,091
and others I've worked with in the past,

176
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:29,631
especially Dan Fernandez, to whom I am eternally grateful.

177
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,611
And finally, I hope, if nothing else,

178
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:34,452
you've gained the confidence to feel like you can do this.

179
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,631
It's not out of your reach.

180
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:39,652
Don't get discouraged if success doesn't come easy.

181
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:42,752
If you hit roadblocks, just take your time

182
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,731
and work through them methodically, and be patient.

183
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:48,732
I try to make all this look easy,

184
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,693
and for the most part, it really is.

185
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:53,352
But not everything is simple at first glance.

186
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,712
I have the benefit of editing out my mistakes,

187
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,532
reshooting if something doesn't work the first time,

188
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,073
working off a script.

189
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:04,133
But real life software development is a little more bumpy,

190
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:09,133
and there's more struggle to it, no matter who you are.

191
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:11,552
Everybody has to go through the struggling at some point,

192
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:13,813
as they begin to learn software development in general,

193
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:15,773
and then specifically this stuff.

194
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:18,372
The only difference between you and I

195
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,992
is that I've been doing all of this for 20 years.

196
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:24,772
I just took tiny baby steps on a daily basis.

197
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:27,933
Frankly, you already know more about software development,

198
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,373
by watching these videos

199
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,872
or the Absolute Beginner videos on C#,

200
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:34,472
than I knew in the first couple years

201
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,732
that I was writing code,

202
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,812
so you've already got a great headstart.

203
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:40,632
But, you can do it.

204
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:44,293
And when you do it, when you finally finish,

205
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:45,593
go ahead and send me a tweet

206
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:46,953
and let me know what you came up with.

207
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,832
I'd love to encourage you, and to just take a look

208
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,132
at what you came up with, it would be exciting for me, too,

209
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,613
and I'd love to see it.

210
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:55,673
So, I sincerely wish you the best

211
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:59,393
as you begin your career writing apps for Windows 10.

212
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:01,642
Good luck, and thank you.
