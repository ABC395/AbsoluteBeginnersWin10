00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,963
<v ->Hi. I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net</v>

2
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:09,861
and this is the solution to the challenge

3
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:13,625
that I call the "Legendary Layout Challenge".

4
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:16,220
Now, remember, don't be watching this solution

5
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,453
unless you've already cracked open Visual Studio

6
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:20,516
and written a line of code or two.

7
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:23,050
Ideally, you would only watch enough of this video

8
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:24,053
to get unstuck.

9
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:25,173
Remember? Okay.

10
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:28,067
Well, let's go ahead and get started then.

11
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:29,809
So let's create a new project.

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,809
I'm going to call this one LegendaryLayout

13
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:39,526
and click OK.

14
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:47,695
And we'll shut that down and open the MainPage.xaml

15
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:50,060
and I'm going to expose more

16
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:53,154
of the XAML editor than the Designer,

17
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:57,264
although I am going to set the Designer to that 13.3 Desktop

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,968
just to give myself some more space here.

19
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,103
As you can see, it gives me

20
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:03,621
quite a bit more horizontal space, especially at 300%.

21
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:06,542
Let's tone that down to 100%.

22
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:07,954
That's a little better.

23
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:08,852
Okay, great.

24
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:12,580
Now let's take a look at the screenshot.

25
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:16,613
So I have what looks to be like one row,

26
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:18,652
I guess you could call it, here at the very top.

27
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:23,652
And then I have a series of stack panels

28
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:26,440
that look to be going

29
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:31,440
in an Orientation equals Horizontal fashion.

30
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,548
And then we'll worry about this last part here

31
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,748
a little bit later, but we know this one is going to be 250.

32
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:39,052
This one's going to 500 wide.

33
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:40,644
And this is going to be 300 wide.

34
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:42,494
We have some margins and things like that too.

35
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,189
Okay, let's get cracking.

36
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,741
So I'm going to get rid of the Grid.

37
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:46,727
We don't need that.

38
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:50,537
And we're going to start off with StackPanel.

39
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:55,859
And inside that StackPanel, I'm going to add a TextBlock,

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,048
come back to that, and then another StackPanel

41
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,706
and we said the Orientation is going to be Horizontal.

42
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:04,529
All right. So far, so good.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,651
Let's remove some of this,

44
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:09,862
so we can keep this clear in our mind.

45
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,390
I think the text was Lorem Ipsum,

46
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:18,390
and if I recall, the font size was going to be 48 again.

47
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,193
Okay, and there's going to be some margins and things.

48
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:23,299
We'll tackle those later.

49
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,178
All right, next up, we're going to need

50
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,560
three TextBlocks inside of this,

51
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,940
or two TextBlocks rather.

52
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,142
They shouldn't be self enclosing.

53
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:34,545
Let's go ahead and get rid of that.

54
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:39,398
There we go.

55
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:43,350
And then I know that final little flag area

56
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,821
with the blue and the red and the yellow squares,

57
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:50,821
that's going to be another StackPanel of Rectangles.

58
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:53,985
So I'm just going to add three Rectangles here

59
00:02:53,986 --> 00:02:55,718
then I'll come back to those.

60
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,486
Okay. So that's my basic layout.

61
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:58,655
You can see kind of what I do.

62
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,487
I get a mental picture of the general layout.

63
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:04,338
And I can test this theory or this little design

64
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,678
by just looking at what I've got so far

65
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,648
inside of the Designer

66
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:10,286
but I'm pretty sure I'm close on this one.

67
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:13,284
All right. So, inside of each of the TextBlocks,

68
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:16,320
what I'm going to do is go and grab some Lorem Ipsum.

69
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,383
Minimize all this.

70
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:18,690
Open this file up.

71
00:03:18,691 --> 00:03:22,778
And I only need the first two lines of this

72
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:28,761
for this first TextBlock.

73
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:29,830
I'll clean this up a little bit

74
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,286
so it looks better in my code.

75
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,658
Okay, I can get rid of that.

76
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,096
And then I'll put three lines

77
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,546
in this other one.

78
00:03:41,657 --> 00:03:45,032
That's here.

79
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,500
Paste.

80
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,528
That and that.

81
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:58,545
All right. Good.

82
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,188
And I know that we want the width of this to be 250

83
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:09,188
and we want the width of this to be 500.

84
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,272
Now let's take a look at what we've got so far

85
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:12,638
here in the Designer,

86
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,778
and you can see that we've only got one line.

87
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:17,356
Remember what I said you had to do to fix this?

88
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:22,177
You have to set the TextWrapping equal to Wrap

89
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,936
in order to get it to kind of flow

90
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:28,936
through the entire space of that text block.

91
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:31,908
Do the same thing here.

92
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:34,119
All right. That should take care of that.

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,278
We got some margin issues to work on

94
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,884
but we'll worry about that in a moment.

95
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:40,725
So, let's see.

96
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:45,259
We want the Orientation on this to be Horizontal,

97
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,542
and so this will have a fill of blue

98
00:04:50,383 --> 00:04:53,996
and we're going to put the width of it at...

99
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:57,347
I believe it was 200 by 200.

100
00:04:57,348 --> 00:05:00,527
Height: 200.

101
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,598
And then the fill of the first one, I think, was red

102
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:09,546
and the fill of the second one was yellow.

103
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,502
And what we're going to need to do here

104
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:15,605
is actually add another StackPanel

105
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:19,103
to get these to kind of stack on top of each other.

106
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:21,972
So let's grab these,

107
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,102
and then we're going to set

108
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:27,538
their width and height to 100.

109
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,542
Like that.

110
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,752
All right. So now let's see what that looks like.

111
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:42,029
All right, something not quite right about there.

112
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,769
This, you can see

113
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,779
that the Rectangle wants to center itself

114
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,183
inside of the vertical space available.

115
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,692
So we're just going to set

116
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:56,832
the VerticalAlignment equal to Top

117
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,830
and that should fix that.

118
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:01,759
All right. We need some margins now.

119
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,379
Let's go back here and let's view the image.

120
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,094
Looks like there's 20 here, 10 here.

121
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:10,094
10 here, 10 here?

122
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:12,114
Maybe 20?

123
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,695
It should be about 10, I think.

124
00:06:13,696 --> 00:06:16,125
So we'll go 20.

125
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,182
Maybe we should use 20.

126
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,677
That does look like a lot of space for 10.

127
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,101
Yeah, it's probably 20.

128
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:26,101
All right. So we'll just go, for the entire StackPanel,

129
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,501
Margin 10

130
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:30,794
and then...

131
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:31,744
Let's see the top.

132
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,554
Do we have some space at the top?

133
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:36,570
Let's go ahead and put just 20 at the top.

134
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:41,570
And then we'll put 20 underneath this one.

135
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:47,067
So, 0,0,0,20 margin

136
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:52,173
for the text block at the top.

137
00:06:52,174 --> 00:06:53,694
All right.

138
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,734
On this first text block, we're going to set

139
00:06:56,735 --> 00:07:01,734
the margin 0,0,20,0

140
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,448
and we'll do the same thing for the one next to it.

141
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,010
And I think we are pretty much done.

142
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,225
Let's go ahead, first of all,

143
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:19,545
and get rid of the frame counter.

144
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:25,229
Save that, and now let's run the app.

145
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,927
All right. I may have too much space here in the top

146
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:32,927
so I may not have needed that margin there at the top.

147
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,239
However, I think everything else looks pretty good.

148
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,161
So, I think that's the solution to the challenge.

149
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,042
Hopefully you got it.

150
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,520
If you didn't or if you struggle with this one,

151
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:48,656
go back and watch the video on StackPanel

152
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:51,417
and then maybe come back to this tomorrow.

153
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,020
All right. Let's move on. We got one more challenge

154
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:54,625
and it's going to be a little bit more difficult.

155
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:57,533
We'll see you there. Thanks!
