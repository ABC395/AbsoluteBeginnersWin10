00:00:04,268 --> 00:00:07,857
<v ->Hi. I'm Bob Tabor with www.LearnVisualStudio.NET</v>

2
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:10,486
and I'm here with the third challenge,

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:12,720
the "Laborious Layout Challenge".

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,770
This one's a little trickier

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,832
because you're going to use both multiple Grids

6
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,142
and multiple StackPanels

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,582
and there's probably

8
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,392
a number of different ways to solve this,

9
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:22,582
not just one way.

10
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:27,522
But let's take a look at the challenge itself.

11
00:00:28,273 --> 00:00:31,452
You can see that we've got three sections.

12
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:34,072
Each section starts with a title.

13
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:37,662
The title is offset vertically from the text

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,672
that it's associated with.

15
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,092
Below each section of text,

16
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:43,412
there's a little flag-like area

17
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:46,422
with three rectangles of different colors.

18
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,732
I guess the last thing I want to point out

19
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,472
is that there are some margin space here on the left

20
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:54,032
and here between each of the titled areas.

21
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:54,872
All right, so let's take a look

22
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:57,153
at the rules for this challenge.

23
00:00:57,154 --> 00:01:00,544
First of all, you have to use both Grids and StackPanels.

24
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:04,044
Even if you think you can just use StackPanels or Grids, no.

25
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:06,395
I'm forcing you to use both together

26
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:10,095
just to prove that point that you can use both together.

27
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:14,245
Secondly, here again I've set the designer

28
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:16,995
at the Desktop, not the phone size,

29
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:20,105
just so I get more horizontal space.

30
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:21,985
The next requirement is that the width

31
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,175
of the entire layout should be 500 pixels.

32
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:26,415
So from this side over here on the left

33
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,155
to this here on the right,

34
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:30,185
you'll notice that that gives us a lot of extra space

35
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:31,395
over in the right, that's okay.

36
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:32,635
Again, this is just a challenge.

37
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:35,125
This is not real life.

38
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:39,145
Number four, the text comes from the LoremIpsum file.

39
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:41,765
I think all you need is that very first line of Lorem Ipsum.

40
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:44,146
There's like five lines, or paragraphs rather.

41
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,336
You just need the first paragraph.

42
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:49,696
Most of the margins are either 10 or 20 pixels again.

43
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:53,607
The Title TextBlocks have a font size of 24 points,

44
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,457
so here, 24-point.

45
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,407
The Rectangles should be 100 wide

46
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:02,177
by 30 tall.

47
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:04,927
The color of the rectangles should be,

48
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,377
as you can see, Green, Black, Red,

49
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,057
Red, Black, Blue,

50
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:10,787
Blue, and off to the bottom of the screen,

51
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,597
you can barely see it, but Blue, Black, Yellow, okay?

52
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:15,537
It should be easy enough for that.

53
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:19,817
Also, use this image,

54
00:02:19,818 --> 00:02:23,907
the UWP-015-Screenshot as your guide

55
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:26,487
as you're working on this.

56
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:29,697
And let me see what else I can tell you.

57
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:31,987
Oh yeah, just, as usual,

58
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:34,997
just try to do this without my help.

59
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:36,687
If you need some help, that's great.

60
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:37,977
But I want you to struggle a little bit

61
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:41,527
before you sneak peek at the solution.

62
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,457
After you've finished it,

63
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,877
you might want to compare what you did

64
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:44,977
versus what I did

65
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:47,657
because there are so many different ways to solve this one.

66
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:51,677
Hopefully you'll at least be open to another technique

67
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:54,207
for solving this challenge, okay?

68
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,077
So, good luck.

69
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:55,867
Again, this is...

70
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:56,907
Now this one's going to be rougher

71
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:58,017
but I know you can do it.

72
00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,357
If you solved the previous two,

73
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:01,627
this one, maybe not a breeze,

74
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,057
but you should be able to do it.

75
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,697
So let's see what you come up with in the solution video.

76
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:07,290
See you there.
