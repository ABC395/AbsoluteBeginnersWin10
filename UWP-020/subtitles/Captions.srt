00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,549
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.LearnVisualStudio.net,</v>      

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,019
and I just wanted to take this lesson and cover some      

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,419
of the most basic input controls that      

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,749
we haven't already covered up to this point.      

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,449
We're going to need some of these input controls      

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,219
for future projects.      

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,149
Also I just want to do a review of all the controls      

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,889
eventually and so we'll get to that.      

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,109
We're going to cover seven in rapid fire      

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,359
in this lesson.      

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,149
You see that I've created a new project: ControlsExamplePart1      

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,319
and I've really done nothing to it just yet.      

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,249
I'm going to drag and drop an image that should be included      

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,189
with the download associated with this lesson.      

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,249
I'm just going to drag and drop if from my desktop      

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,219
into my Assets folder      

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,080
so you can see it now appear here.      

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,509
All right, and we're going to need that      

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,309
in just a little bit.      

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,789
So I'm going to copy and paste most of the code      

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,119
for this lesson just because there's so much of it.      

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,149
And there's really three things that I want to learn      

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,289
about each control.      

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,150
First of all, how do I display it on screen?      

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,419
Secondly, how do I handle the major events      

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,049
that it will emit whether it be a tapped      

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,589
or a selection changed, whatever the case might be?      

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,289
And then third, how do I retrieve the value      

29
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,700
out of that control,      

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,019
the current selection, whatever has been typed in,      

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,689
whatever has been checked or unchecked,      

32
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,989
things of that nature, okay?      

33
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,140
So the first input control that we want to look at      

34
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,349
is the CheckBox,      

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,049
a very simple yes/no control.      

36
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,399
As you can see, we create a new CheckBox      

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,709
and I set the content to      

38
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,349
a label that will be displayed      

39
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,519
by default to the right of that square, that CheckBox.      

40
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,019
The user will tap it to check it or tap it to uncheck it.      

41
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,919
So we have a Tapped event that we can handle.      

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,649
And inside of this, what I want to do is just      

43
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,779
display in the label below it or the TextBox below it,      

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,719
whether the CheckBox is currently checked or not.      

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,619
Now there's also a Checked event, however, it only      

46
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,489
fires once and then it never fires again      

47
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,319
and that's not what we want.      

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,349
We want to handle every time that particular control      

49
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,600
has been touched.      

50
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,289
So you can see, when I check it or uncheck it,      

51
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,549
I get the IsCheck property equals true or false, great.      

52
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,349
All right, we're off to a great start.      

53
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,919
All right, the next thing that I want to look at      

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,649
is a RadioButton which is similar to a CheckBox      

55
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,799
however it will allow you to add      

56
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,949
multiple potential values      

57
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,689
each grouped together by a GroupName.      

58
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,479
So all the radio buttons that belong together      

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,819
you have to give it the same GroupName.      

60
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,149
You can have two groups of radio buttons,      

61
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,969
and the selections will be unique within      

62
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,589
each of those groups.      

63
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,149
So here again, I'm setting the Content property.      

64
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,369
It'll be a label off to the right-hand side      

65
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,139
of the actual RadioButton itself.      

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,519
RadioButtons are not really buttons,      

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,599
they're more like CheckBoxes, so that's an odd name,      

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,349
but I guess because it's a button like a button on a shirt      

69
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,329
it's circular.      

70
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,749
So let's see, the other thing that we want to do,      

71
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,949
we can handle the Checked event again.      

72
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,689
I'm not sure we're going to get the results we want.      

73
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,219
Here, I'm going to go ahead and go along with that,      

74
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,549
so I'll hit F12 on my keyboard.      

75
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,929
And here we will set the      

76
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,849
RadioButtonTextBlock below it      

77
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,219
to the Text and we'll just use this ternary operator.      

78
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,679
We'll either say yes or no.      

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,723
So let's go ahead and run the application now.      

80
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,270
And so we'll select yes or no, or yes or no, okay.      

81
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,781
And we could add as many RadioButtons as we want      

82
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:52,249
but it typically only works well      

83
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,019
with four or five selections at most.      

84
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,919
If you have more than that, then you'll probably      

85
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,219
want to move onto a different type of control for input.      

86
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,281
All right, so we've covered those two.      

87
00:04:03,282 --> 00:04:05,849
Let's move on to the next one and look at a ComboBox.      

88
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,719
And a ComboBox will allow you to create a number      

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,840
of ComboBoxItems, each with their own value.      

90
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,620
Let's go ahead and format this a little bit.      

91
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,180
If I stuff in the paste.      

92
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,149
All right, so here we have a ComboBox,      

93
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,589
and we're handling a SelectionChanged event      

94
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,189
so whenever somebody makes a different selection      

95
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,909
in the ComboBox, we want to handle that and then      

96
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,349
take whatever the new selection was and display that      

97
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,109
in the label below or in the TextBlock below.      

98
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,849
You can see that we created a number of individual      

99
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,049
TextBox items that will show up in the dropdown list      

100
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,349
and we can even say, "Hey, this one should be selected."      

101
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,619
In fact, I'm going to move this one just to prove this.      

102
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,519
We'll move it to the last one will be selected by default.      

103
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,149
All right, and then in this SelectionChanged event here      

104
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,430
I want to handle that.      

105
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,919
And I'm going to go ahead and paste in the code.      

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,789
It's a little bit tricky honestly.      

107
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,079
The way that we retrieve the value is that we're going to      

108
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,519
use the sender that was passed in      

109
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,379
in order to get a reference to      

110
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,920
the ComboBox itself, and then to get      

111
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,609
access to the SelectedItem that was chosen      

112
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,349
from the ComboBox,      

113
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,209
then we're going to choose combo.SelectedItem      

114
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,449
and we're going to cast that to a ComboBoxItem.      

115
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,019
And only then can we retrieve the Content of that      

116
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,249
ComboBoxItem and display that in the TextBlock below.      

117
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,070
So let's go ahead and run the application.      

118
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,689
And here you can see sixth was chosen because we set      

119
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,409
the IsSelected property to true for that.      

120
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,589
But when I make different selections you can see      

121
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,089
how they show up here in the label to the right-hand side.      

122
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,489
So that's how we get access to the SelectedItem.      

123
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,720
This is great because you can      

124
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,969
have a long list of items unlike a RadioButton.      

125
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,179
However, they're all hidden and it might not be completely      

126
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,949
obvious to the user that there are many other options.      

127
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,289
In this case, you might want to choose a ListBox instead.      

128
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,079
Now the ListBox is going to be a pretty important control      

129
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,449
when we go forward, when we're creating      

130
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,019
our hamburger navigation.      

131
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,589
There's a bunch of different ways that we can create      

132
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,689
that hamburger navigation that's popular in Windows 10.      

133
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,519
I choose the ListBox for reasons that I'll demonstrate      

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,089
in an upcoming lesson      

135
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,819
to kind of follow up on a promise that I made earlier.      

136
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,489
However, let's go ahead and take a look.      

137
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,489
It, too, has a SelectionChanged event.      

138
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,709
Let's go ahead and handle that.      

139
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,519
What makes the ListBox a little bit different than      

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,189
the other items like the radio and the ComboBox,      

141
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,399
is that several items can be selected.      

142
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,989
Take a look here that I changed the SelectionMode      

143
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,519
which is by default a single item,      

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,719
and I changed it to Multiple,      

145
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,509
so you could select multiples.      

146
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,519
And what I want to do is use this link query      

147
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,819
against all of the ListBoxItems      

148
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,129
for those items where the IsSelected property      

149
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,281
is true and then I want to grab out just the      

150
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:19,989
Content property of those selected items,      

151
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,309
put them in an Array of strings      

152
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,349
and then I'm going to call string.Join()      

153
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,989
to concatenate them all together      

154
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,049
for display into the TextBlock below.      

155
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,182
So let's go ahead and run this      

156
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:35,349
and you can see what I mean by all that.      

157
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,449
All right, so I'll select the first one, the second,      

158
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,549
the third, I'll get rid of the second one,      

159
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,349
I'll get rid of the First one, I'll add the Second one.      

160
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,579
So you can see how that works.      

161
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,919
Now what we'll use it for, when we actually do use it      

162
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,019
in an upcoming lesson,      

163
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,379
we'll change the SelectionMode.      

164
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,049
It'll just be Single selection.      

165
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,879
But one of the features that I like about it      

166
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,849
is that once you make a selection,      

167
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,589
it actually will keep that selection highlighted      

168
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,549
which is one of the things that we noted about the      

169
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,419
hamburger navigation style on the money app,      

170
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,419
the sports app, the ones that are built-in to Windows 10.      

171
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,749
Okay, we'll come back to ListBox some day soon here.      

172
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,719
Now let's move on.      

173
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,880
I want to show you      

174
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,669
the Image control      

175
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,619
because it too will be used in an upcoming exercise.      

176
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,789
And the Image control will do just like what it says.      

177
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,389
It will display an image.      

178
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,719
However, there is this interesting property.      

179
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,179
First of all, you set the Source.      

180
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,889
And in this case the Source is going to be relative      

181
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,689
to the root of our projects.      

182
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,049
So we're going to look in the Assets folder      

183
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,049
for a logo.png.      

184
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,349
We could also supply it a location across the internet      

185
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,470
or some other folder in our application.      

186
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,219
The thing that I wanted to point out which      

187
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,419
is interesting here is the Stretch property.      

188
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,881
And there's a couple different options      

189
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,449
and I'll go through each of them here      

190
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,049
as we run the application over and over.      

191
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,989
So first of all the Stretch property is None      

192
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,409
which means we're not going to stretch      

193
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,249
the property to fit the available space.      

194
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,719
There's no stretching at all.      

195
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,509
We're just going to put it in its original size      

196
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,949
which as you can see is quite large.      

197
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,660
Next we're going to change the Stretch property to      

198
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,389
Fill, and let's see what that does for us.      

199
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,740
So the Fill selection will say, okay, it's a      

200
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,619
250px wide by 50px tall area      

201
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,559
so fill it up to the best that you can      

202
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
so it'll just stretch that Image out of shape      

203
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,819
and make it distorted but it will fill up      

204
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,120
the entire area.      

205
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,849
And then the next one that we'll look at is      

206
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,119
Uniform and that will make sure that      

207
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,589
it's not distorted and it's actually resized correctly      

208
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,409
so that it fits in the available area,      

209
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,149
but there's a lot of extra area here that is unused      

210
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,889
off to the right-hand side.      

211
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,929
Finally, UniformToFill is the last option.      

212
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,469
It's going to look a lot like None      

213
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,089
that we looked at earlier, however,      

214
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,089
it's going to keep the proportions correct.      

215
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,709
It's just going to stretch out the proportions      

216
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,599
to fit the available space.      

217
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,849
And again this might not be so obvious in this example,      

218
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,219
however, if you have a different size boundary      

219
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,509
and a different type of image or size of image,      

220
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,219
you might see some change in how that looks.      

221
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,089
All right, so let's go ahead and move on from there      

222
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,989
to the ToggleButton.      

223
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,259
And the ToggleButton is just      

224
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,519
a stateful Button,      

225
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,289
so you can click it on and you can click it off.      

226
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,449
There's also an option to make it a ThreeState,      

227
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,189
so you can click it and give it no value,      

228
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,419
click it on or click it off.      

229
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,149
And so I've set the IsThreeState="True"      

230
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,749
so that we can see it at work.      

231
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,819
Here I'm going to handle the      

232
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,389
MyToggleButton_Click event      

233
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,339
and inside of here      

234
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,909
I'm merely going to display whether      

235
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,489
the ToggleButton is on or off,      

236
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,400
if it's Checked or Unchecked.      

237
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,800
Let's go ahead and run it.      

238
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:18,849
I see the Premium Option.      

239
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,090
I turn it to true.      

240
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,709
I click it again, which sets the      

241
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,389
IsChecked to Null essentially      

242
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,489
and then I check it again and it's false.      

243
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,849
So that's ThreeState.      

244
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,749
We can turn it to TwoState and it will be simply      

245
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,640
one click on, one click off.      

246
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,239
Then the last one that we're      

247
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,419
going to look at here is similar to that      

248
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,450
except it's called the ToggleSwitch.      

249
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,189
The ToggleSwitch allows us to      

250
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,189
toggle between two states.      

251
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,689
And we see this control used often in the Settings panel      

252
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,770
in Windows 10.      

253
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,619
What you can do that's interesting is actually set a      

254
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,569
Content area for what should be displayed      

255
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,819
whenever the Toggle is in an off position or an on position.      

256
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,089
You can also handle other events but this will be      

257
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,719
primarily how it's used to display the current state      

258
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,009
of the toggle.      

259
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,360
So let's go ahead and run that application one more time.      

260
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,519
And you can see I've set it to "I'm off right now".      

261
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,819
I can turn it on and "I'm on".      

262
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,649
I'm off, I'm on.      

263
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,519
And I just used a simple TextBlock,      

264
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,019
but if you got creative you could do quite a bit with this.      

265
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,349
Okay, so that's all I wanted to cover in this lesson.      

266
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,619
Hopefully, you were able to see      

267
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,289
for each of the controls that we covered,      

268
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,649
how to display it,      

269
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,520
if we can, how do we handle the events      

270
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,849
that it emits or how do we set properties      

271
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,419
that are special to that particular control,      

272
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,119
and then also finally how to retrieve the current      

273
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,649
selected value out of that control.      

274
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,889
All right, so let's continue on.      

275
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:58,719
We're doing great.      

276
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,849
We'll see you in the next lesson.      

277
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,870
Thank you.
