00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:08,492
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net</v>

2
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:11,632
and this is the solution, or at least part of the solution

3
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,841
for the challenge I called the Stupendous Styles Challenge.

4
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:18,081
In this first video there's going to be a lot of setup work,

5
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:20,913
we're going to create the Project, add the Pages,

6
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:24,323
copy over the Assets from that .zip file,

7
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,663
that folder that I have on my desktop there.

8
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,322
We'll work on navigation,

9
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:30,713
styling up the Buttons, creating Styles.

10
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:33,024
So I'm going to go ahead and turn off the webcam

11
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:36,154
so I can make facial expressions and not

12
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:41,214
distract you with my ugly mug.

13
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:43,566
And let's go ahead and create a New Project

14
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:47,031
and we'll call this GoNuts,

15
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:49,311
click OK.

16
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:52,752
And just so we can get it out of the way,

17
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,532
the very first thing I'm going to do is

18
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:59,539
take all the image assets from that folder

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,040
and I'm going to go to View, and go to Detail view.

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,431
It'll be easier that way.

21
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:09,131
And I'll take everything here

22
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:11,534
and I'll drag and drop it into the Assets folder.

23
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,114
Alright, very good.

24
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,924
So now I can get rid of that and I can

25
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:18,755
give myself some more space here.

26
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:24,345
Next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add

27
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:29,286
all of those Pages, Blank Pages, to my Project.

28
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,446
So let's go.

29
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,009
We already have a MainPage.xaml so we need

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,421
a DonutPage.xaml.

31
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:43,471
I wonder how many projects in the history of Visual Studio

32
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:46,101
have had a DonutPage in them.

33
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:52,221
CoffeePage.xaml,

34
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:00,641
SchedulePage.xaml,

35
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:11,141
and this was CompletePage.xaml.

36
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:16,264
So we're good to go there.

37
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:20,475
And while I'm here I'm going to go ahead and remove

38
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:24,335
this DEBUG statement, get rid of the Frame counter,

39
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:26,805
and we're good to go there, I'll just close that up.

40
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:29,266
So the first thing I'm going to do is set up

41
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,866
the structure on that MainPage.

42
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:33,667
I do want to change the view to this 13.3" Desktop.

43
00:02:33,668 --> 00:02:37,238
I just prefer working in that landscape mode.

44
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,109
And so we said that we're going to create

45
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,639
two Grid rows, so let's go ahead

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,825
and create some Grid.RowDefinitions here.

47
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:50,640
Grid.RowDefinitions and

48
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,420
we'll set the height

49
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,408
and copy it.

50
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,228
I do a lot of that, where I know that I need something

51
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:04,156
so I create the structure,

52
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,882
copy it a bunch of times and then fill in the details.

53
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,212
It just saves keystrokes that way.

54
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:14,809
So that top Row will be, actually I don't want it Auto,

55
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,000
I want it 100 like we specified in the instructions.

56
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:23,157
So in that top row we're going to have a Grid

57
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,318
and in the bottom row we're going to have a Grid as well.

58
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:30,264
Now I know in the bottom row

59
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:31,764
that Grid's going to have two Columns, so I'm going to

60
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:33,481
go ahead and just kind of lay that out right now.

61
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:37,971
So column, whoops, ColumnDefinitions.

62
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:41,719
And ColumnDefinition, I want the Width,

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,077
remember it was going to be 66% on the left,

64
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:46,523
33% on the right.

65
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:52,063
So how do we do that?

66
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:53,763
Width="2*",

67
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:56,603
Width="1*", great.

68
00:03:57,274 --> 00:04:00,453
And on the left we're going to use a Frame,

69
00:04:00,454 --> 00:04:02,322
so let's go ahead and just add a Frame,

70
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:04,143
and we'll fill in the details to that later.

71
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,329
Well actually I'll just call this MyFrame,

72
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,899
cause that's all I need to really do.

73
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,116
Equals MyFrame.

74
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:13,555
And then on the right we're going to put an Image.

75
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:19,602
And we'll set the Source="Assets/background.jpg"

76
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:21,856
Source="Assets/background.jpg".

77
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,030
And I'm going to set that Grid.Column="1"

78
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,571
Grid.Column="1", and I know I'm going to have to do

79
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:33,682
something else there but I'll see where we're at after that.

80
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,223
Next up I'm going to create,

81
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:39,404
this topmost Grid is going to have four Columns.

82
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,844
So let's just do this, actually.

83
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:45,024
That'll give me a good start.

84
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:52,526
And then each of these will just be, have an

85
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:56,556
equal share of the width, so they're all have "*" sizing.

86
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,307
And then I need buttons.

87
00:04:59,308 --> 00:05:03,007
And what I'm going to do is actually just create one Button,

88
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:07,007
get it right, extract the Style,

89
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,527
and then create the other Buttons.

90
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:13,324
So I know inside the button I'm going to have a StackPanel,

91
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:17,680
because I want an icon, so I'm going to have an Image

92
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:21,290
on the left and then the TextBlock on the right.

93
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:24,110
Okay, so far so good.

94
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:27,121
The TextBlock, let's go ahead and set its

95
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:29,591
Text="Donut", in this case.

96
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:35,057
And the Image Asset, whoops, the Image Source

97
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:41,118
will equal "Assets/donut-icon.png".

98
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,828
And I'll have to play around with the sizes of those things.

99
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:48,108
I do know that I want the Background for this thing

100
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:52,338
to be black and I want the Foreground="White".

101
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,429
So that's good there

102
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,279
and like I give you the hint in the instructions,

103
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,081
I want these Buttons to take up the entire size

104
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:04,961
of the cell that they're sitting in.

105
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:08,962
First of all let me go ahead and do Grid.Column="0".

106
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:10,362
I know I don't have to do that on this one

107
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,429
but it'll remind me to do it on the others.

108
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,063
The next thing that I wanna do is

109
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:18,163
oh yeah, that HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"

110
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:20,475
and the VerticalAlignment="Stretch".

111
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:25,927
And that will make it the entire size of the cell.

112
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,227
If not it'll just be really small,

113
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,967
just large enough for the text inside of it

114
00:06:30,968 --> 00:06:33,657
to actually display, or whatever the content is.

115
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,837
See what the preview looks like.

116
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:41,319
Alright. Clearly things are not looking great just yet.

117
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,061
Oh, I see what we need to do here.

118
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:50,762
So this Grid.Row="1".

119
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,383
That should fix that issue.

120
00:06:52,384 --> 00:06:54,053
And we'll get back to that in a minute.

121
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:56,903
Up here it looks like this Image is

122
00:06:56,904 --> 00:06:58,863
way too large in the preview.

123
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:02,135
I think all I really need is like 20x20.

124
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:06,180
So let's go Width="20" and Height="20"

125
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:11,531
Height="20", and I think the TextBlock's icon,

126
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:15,753
so the Foreground would equal White,

127
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:18,493
and I don't think we need that there, actually.

128
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:25,063
And then the, so the TextBlock, the Donut, Foreground,

129
00:07:26,976 --> 00:07:28,867
oh, StackPanel, yeah we need that.

130
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:31,387
I can barely see it, and it didn't look quite right.

131
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:34,248
The Orientation needs to be "Horizontal".

132
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:37,460
Alright, that looks a little bit better.

133
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:39,480
Let's run it and see what we've got so far.

134
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:44,430
And you'll notice in these solutions that

135
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:49,053
I do a lot of coding and then afterwards

136
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:52,855
I test it but honestly

137
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:56,946
what I typically do is do a lot of testing.

138
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,486
I just don't want it to take forever long

139
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,336
recording these videos, okay?

140
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:03,336
So let's go ahead and shut that down.

141
00:08:08,017 --> 00:08:10,507
I need to add one more thing in here,

142
00:08:10,508 --> 00:08:14,187
and what I need to do is to set that BorderBrush,

143
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,747
remember we talked about that,

144
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:18,979
and let's set that to Gray, and then we're going to set the

145
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,279
BorderThickness to, and this works just like margins do,

146
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,739
so on the left I want a "0", on the top

147
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,519
I want a "0", on the right I want a "2",

148
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,260
and on the bottom I want "0" BorderThickness.

149
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,150
So now let's take a look at that.

150
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,900
And it might be hard to see against the white background

151
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:39,801
but there's a little tiny gray border there on the right.

152
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:41,501
Now you can also see while I'm in here

153
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:42,761
that this doesn't look quite right.

154
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:46,651
I think I need to set the Stretch property of that Image.

155
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:53,482
Let's go Stretch="UniformToFill",

156
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,103
and I think that will fix the issue.

157
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:57,493
So let's run it again.

158
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:02,004
Okay that's more like it. Great.

159
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:05,664
Now what I want to do is extract a Style

160
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:09,604
from this Button so we can apply it.

161
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,945
So Page.Resources,

162
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,285
and here I'm going to create a Style,

163
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:22,748
TargetType, sorry about that,

164
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:25,965
Style, TargetType="Button",

165
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:29,460
and then let's get a Key.

166
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:33,180
And I try to be as descriptive as possible with the Keys.

167
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:37,920
So NavigationButtonStyle, there's no mistaking what that is.

168
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:40,170
Here we're going to create a bunch of Setters,

169
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:44,242
and we'll set the Property and then

170
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:48,622
the Value and just like I've done before I'm going to copy

171
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,754
and paste a bunch of these cause I know I need them.

172
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:52,754
Don't know exactly how many.

173
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:54,726
Now here's what I'd like to do.

174
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,851
Because I need to look down here

175
00:09:57,852 --> 00:09:59,351
and then make changes up here,

176
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:02,611
I use a feature Visual Studio, let's get rid of that,

177
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:04,553
this little icon in the upper right-hand corner

178
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,993
allows me to see two Panes with the same file.

179
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:10,093
So I'm still on the MainPage.xaml but I'm looking at

180
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:12,164
these two independent Panes.

181
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,615
So I can look at the bottom down here like that,

182
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,465
and then here at the top

183
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:21,566
I can do things like set the Background, and I love

184
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,726
that I get IntelliSense when I do this by the way.

185
00:10:23,727 --> 00:10:25,236
That's nice.

186
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,097
Background Black.

187
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:35,558
HorizontalAlignment="Stretch".

188
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:47,798
And VerticalAlignment, and we'll set that to "Stretch".

189
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:54,218
And let's see, we'll do the BorderBrush,

190
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,838
and we'll set that equal to "Gray",

191
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:00,980
and then the BorderThickness

192
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:09,170
equal to that,

193
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:13,123
and I think that's all that I need to do right now.

194
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:16,644
Now what I'll do is grab all this, remove it,

195
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:21,144
and I'm going to set the Style equal to

196
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:23,684
that StaticResource, right?

197
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:28,946
And we're calling this NavigationButtonStyle

198
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:32,326
NavigationButtonStyle.

199
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:37,106
Now if I did this right, and I'm going to remove that,

200
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,586
nothing will change whenever I run the app.

201
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:43,678
Great. Looks right.

202
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,858
Now I do notice I still have some things I need to do here

203
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,132
with the innards of the Button on the Image itself.

204
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,272
And this might be an area where we can create another Style

205
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:56,202
because we're going to use this four times.

206
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:58,702
So let me

207
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:03,092
let me first get the margin right, correct, rather,

208
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,955
and let's go

209
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:10,775
Margin="0,0,10,0", maybe?

210
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,389
That should work, right? So let's try it.

211
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,121
Okay, that's better. Very good.

212
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:21,561
Now let's make a Style out of that.

213
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:24,631
So here we go, Style,

214
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:30,217
TargetType="Image"

215
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,720
and let's create the Key

216
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:37,280
to IconStyle?

217
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:40,152
Think that's good enough? ImageIconStyle?

218
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:42,433
IconImageStyle?

219
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:45,673
Naming things is hard. It's always hard.

220
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:50,133
The Setter and Property and the Value

221
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:53,676
and I think we'll need three things here.

222
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,096
So we're going to set the Height and Width,

223
00:12:58,427 --> 00:12:59,576
set that to 20,

224
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:04,549
width, 20,

225
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,260
and then we're going to do that Margin thing

226
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:09,083
that we did a minute ago where we go

227
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:13,426
Margin="0,0,10,0".

228
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:17,606
I'm going to copy that, because I'll forget that name.

229
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:23,646
And we'll go Style="StaticResource"

230
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,647
and then the IconImageStyle.

231
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:28,617
I'm not going to do one for the TextBlock

232
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:30,130
with the text Donut in it.

233
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,290
There's just no reason for it, I mean,

234
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,190
we only have one property that we're setting there.

235
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,818
Let's make sure everything looks good before we now

236
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,239
copy and paste those Buttons three more times.

237
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,370
Okay. I like what it looks like.

238
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:43,992
One last thing that I need to do is I'm going to need,

239
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:45,673
well, let me just hold off on that.

240
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,363
Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself here.

241
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:51,274
Okay. So I've got these Buttons looking pretty sharp.

242
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:54,264
I'm going to copy and paste

243
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:59,784
so I have one, two, three, four, this will be in Column 1,

244
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:04,364
Column 2, and Column 3.

245
00:14:05,215 --> 00:14:07,495
Alright and so now we'll just change out each of these.

246
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:12,165
So instead of that, we'll go coffee-icon,

247
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,136
and the Text="Coffee".

248
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:21,916
Then I'm going to go schedule-icon

249
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,318
and the TextBlock will be Schedule, and then finally,

250
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,744
what was this, complete-icon,

251
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:36,424
and Complete.

252
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,035
Alright, I feel good about that.

253
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:41,305
Let's see what it looks like real quick.

254
00:14:43,896 --> 00:14:46,445
Nice! Look at that!

255
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:49,335
See how efficient it can be whenever you

256
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:50,818
kind of get your act together and you

257
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,179
you create your Styles, and then you copy and paste things.

258
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,570
Alright, I tell you what, I'm going to stop right here

259
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:03,290
and I'm going to work on the navigation

260
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,550
part of this in the next video.

261
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:06,641
So we'll catch you there.
