1
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:08,466
<v ->So in my music collection,</v>      

2
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:10,438
I literally have...      

3
00:00:11,907 --> 00:00:13,467
hundreds, hundreds of albums      

4
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:16,966
that I've purchased legitimately through the years.      

5
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:21,686
And sometimes I don't even remember what I have,      

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,426
so I can concocted a little game here      

7
00:00:23,427 --> 00:00:27,846
that will allow you to rediscover music that you have      

8
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:30,606
in your music collection, in your music library,      

9
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:33,406
and will make a little game out of it.      

10
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:35,566
And so you've gotta kind of watch closely here      

11
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:38,637
at the game itself.      

12
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:45,227
Alright, so these are songs, or album covers      

13
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:48,356
representing songs on my hard drive.      

14
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:53,308
(music plays)      

15
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:57,886
Ok. And I successfully guessed that song      

16
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:00,667
and I got it right, and I scored 70 points      

17
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:02,098
as a result of that.      

18
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:04,138
Here we go, the next one.      

19
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:07,877
(music plays)      

20
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:11,227
Ok, I missed that one and I lost 80 points,      

21
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:14,977
so I'm at a negative 10 after two rounds,      

22
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,818
as you can see.      

23
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:21,057
(music plays)      

24
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:23,926
Alright, and so as you might guess,      

25
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:26,007
this is not my music collection.      

26
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,266
I'll explain that in the next video,      

27
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:31,347
but these are purely songs that somebody      

28
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:32,997
created for me.      

29
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:35,498
(music plays)      

30
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:38,746
But you can also see here that there's      

31
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,026
a little blue area down here.      

32
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:42,427
This actually represents an advertisement      

33
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,180
from Microsoft Advertisement Network.      

34
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,531
(music plays)      

35
00:01:48,051 --> 00:01:48,875
Okay.      

36
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,595
So you can see that after five rounds,      

37
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:53,376
I've got a massive negative score of 260.      

38
00:01:53,377 --> 00:01:54,677
I can choose to play again,      

39
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,916
but that's really not the most significant thing      

40
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,366
about this application.      

41
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,235
What it will do is it'll allow you to go through      

42
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:06,236
special folders on the user's device      

43
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:10,326
or desktop, specifically the music library.      

44
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:13,396
And it'll go through every single folder      

45
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:14,297
in the music library      

46
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:17,687
and find a list of all MP3 files.      

47
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,716
It'll then grab the metadata from the MP3 file itself,      

48
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:26,357
so information like the album name, the artist's name,      

49
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:32,397
the album art,      

50
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:33,697
so you can see that we've got the cover art      

51
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:35,618
for the album itself,      

52
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:38,217
and then it's going to choose to randomly play songs      

53
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:41,937
and as the user, I then have to guess,      

54
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,177
and it's going to evaluate my guess whether right or wrong      

55
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:47,449
and it will change the tile      

56
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:50,268
as a result of that      

57
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,428
and it'll keep score, and there's a lot of logic      

58
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:55,348
around what songs to play,      

59
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,469
what to stay away from because you've already guessed      

60
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,028
that album art or it's already been used once,      

61
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:03,268
you can't use it because it's already got an X on it,      

62
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,329
sort of thing, okay?      

63
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,949
Like I said, we demonstrate how to use      

64
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,608
and monetize this application through Microsoft Advertising.      

65
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,269
We'll demonstrate that and then we'll also demonstrate      

66
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,788
how to remove ads,      

67
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:18,808
so to add a premium feature to the app      

68
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:22,026
and allow you to monetize it      

69
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:26,076
by allowing the user to click a button      

70
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:27,716
and it'll pop up the      

71
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,796
"are you sure you want to purchase this for a dollar?"      

72
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:33,276
Now, this is a little simulator and we'll talk about this      

73
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:36,836
near the end of our time together building this,      

74
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:38,216
but I'm going to go ahead and say "Yes,"      

75
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,716
the user successfully purchased the removal of ads      

76
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:43,916
in the app.      

77
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,976
And so we're going to demonstrate how to add      

78
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:49,047
in-app purchases in your application.      

79
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,716
So there's a lot to learn in this app,      

80
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:53,596
it's going to be a lot of fun, a lot of logic,      

81
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,196
a lot of typing,      

82
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:57,956
so you'll need to follow along closely or you'll probably,      

83
00:03:57,957 --> 00:04:00,616
honestly you'll probably just want to look at the source code      

84
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,757
after I finish the video,      

85
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,538
but just follow along with the thought process      

86
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,277
as I work my way through this example.      

87
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:07,116
Alright, ready?      

88
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:08,536
Let's get started in the next video.      

89
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:10,208
Thanks.
