00:00:06,984 --> 00:00:08,807
<v Voiceover>Alright so this is the</v>

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:09,905
part of the solution

3
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:13,422
for the Stupendous Styles Challenge that

4
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:17,187
involves the Pickup Date and Time.

5
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,828
As you can see here on the screenshot,

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,426
we're going to need the logo again,

7
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:24,061
we've already got a Style for that, that should be easy.

8
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:25,855
Looks like we're going to need

9
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:33,128
a Row with two Columns in it,

10
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:38,128
and then we'll need that DatePicker and TimePicker.

11
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,337
That should be pretty easy.

12
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:43,933
Let's go ahead and, actually I'll keep that open.

13
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:46,904
Let's get rid of that

14
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:51,543
and so let's open up the SchedulePage.

15
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:54,144
I think the very first thing we can agree on

16
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,735
that we need to do is set the Background="Green".

17
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,142
Okay, and so the next thing I'm going to do is

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,070
actually go to the DonutPage,

19
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:09,327
and I'm going to grab some of this stuff here

20
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:12,273
and I'll grab that,

21
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:13,960
and I'm going to paste it,

22
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,818
see how much did I grab?

23
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,183
Okay, there we go.

24
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:19,697
I sometimes forget what I copy

25
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:22,786
and what I need to paste over.

26
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:27,147
Alright, looks like we're going to need a back Grid down there.

27
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,985
Okay, so let's see what this looks like.

28
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:42,646
Okay, pretty good start.

29
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:47,859
And I think this was supposed to say pickup, right?

30
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:56,140
And here we're going to have the DatePicker

31
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:58,714
I think the DatePicker was on top right?

32
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:00,421
Let's look at this.

33
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:01,619
Yeah date picker

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,018
and in the next row we'll have the time picker, pickup.

35
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:08,268
Great, pickup, DatePicker.

36
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,425
Place holder text? No. Okay.

37
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:21,455
Well, I think that's all we're going to do there.

38
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:24,219
Grid.Row="1"

39
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,219
and a Grid.Column="1".

40
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,896
And then the TimePicker.

41
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:36,429
TimePicker... Grid.Row="2"

42
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,713
Grid.Column="1".

43
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:42,070
There might be some Margins, but you know,

44
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:45,618
this is I think almost all we need.

45
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:52,104
Yeah, I'm not crazy about the date format.

46
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,216
What did we have here?

47
00:02:57,457 --> 00:03:00,297
Select a date, huh.

48
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:05,774
Oh, you know what, I got the wrong DatePicker.

49
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,820
This should be the CalendarDatePicker.

50
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,454
There we go, and let's go ahead and

51
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:15,358
set the Foreground="White" while we're at it.

52
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:20,637
And we'll do the same thing for the TimePicker.

53
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,998
Alright, that's a little more I like it.

54
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:35,718
There we go.

55
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,873
Awesome,

56
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:42,227
and I think that's all we gotta do for that.

57
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,437
See, this one was simple,

58
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:46,057
and most of it was just copy and paste,

59
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:49,224
but there was a lot of functionality on that Page.

60
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:52,685
Okay, so let's, without further ado, let's move on.
