Resize the window, making it larger and smaller.<v ->Hi I'm Bob Tabor and in this series of videos,</v>over 75 videos,I'm going to demonstrate how to build appsthat can be sold or downloaded for free on the Windows Storefor Windows desktop, or phone,or wherever Universal Windows Platform apps can be used.
Which will soon include devices like the Xbox One,Microsoft Hub, and even the HoloLens.
Now that term Universal Windows Platform I just usedit describes tools and APIs that you can utilizeto build apps that run universallyacross all new Windows devices.
And the beauty is that you can write one applicationand it'll look great on many different screen resolutionsand device form factors.
And really that's one of the most important thingsthat I'm going to discuss and demonstratein this series of lessons.
So this series is intended for an absolutebeginner audience.
Having said that, you should already have some familiaritywith C# and Visual Studio.
And I want to assume that you're watching this aftermaking sure that you've either watched or at leastyou understand all the concepts that I discuss inthe C# fundamentals for absolute beginners serieson Microsoft Virtual Academy in channel nine.
You can find it at this URL on the screen.
Now if you're already an experienced developerthen -- fair warning -- quite honestly here,this course is going to move very slow for you.
And we did that on purpose.
And honestly there's probably some better resourcesout there where you can spend your time.
I'd recommend that you watch Andy Wigley and Shen Chauhanin a series that they created calleda developers guide to Windows 10.
Great, up to date, it's awesome.
And I'd recommend you start thereif you're already an experienced developer.
Now this is the fourth version of this particular videoseries that I've created.
And I started way back on the Windows Phone 7in about 2009 / 2010.
Each time that I release a version of this seriesI'm asked a few questions repeatedly.
So I want to answer those right up frontso that there's no misunderstanding.
First of all, you must use Windows 10to build apps for Windows 10,to build Universal Windows Platform apps.
You cannot use Windows 8.1, or Windows 8,or Windows 7, or Windows XP.
Alright, you have to use Windows 10, that's number one.
Number two, you have to use Visual Studio 2015.
Now I recommend that you useVisual Studio 2015 Community Edition,which is a free edition with all the features of Pro editionbut it's intended for individuals who are just learningor creating a community based projects.
Now frankly you can use other editions of Visual Studiobut not previous versions.
You must use version 2015 to buildUniversal Windows Platform apps, that's number two.
Number three, you're going to see me use the phone emulatorin order to run and test my applications occasionally.
It'll look like a little phone running on my screenwith a little menu off to the right hand side.
It's actually running software called Hyper-Vwhich is a platform for running virtual machineson your desktop.
And so it's running the Windows Phone 10 operating systemin a little virtual machine that looks like a phone.
Now you might need special hardwareto run the phone emulator.
Specifically your motherboard and your chipmust support a technology called SLAT,or rather "Second Level Address Translation".
Now most modern motherboards will support this,however not all motherboards and chips support this.
Most importantly, I can't help you with this.
I understand very little about it.
If you get errors during install of Visual Studio 2015then you can search Microsoft's forums for help,but again I can't help you.
I've tried to help in the past and honestly I'veprobably confused more people than I've actually helped.
Now the worst case scenario if you can't getthe emulator running on your local machine,is that you might need to deploy your appsto a physical phone device runningeither the full edition or a beta edition of WindowsPhone 10 for the purpose of testing.
It's simple to do,however I don't demonstrate how to do thatin this series of videos.
There are articles online that'll show you how.
Now if you have all these things in placethen, number four, you're going to need toturn on Developer Mode.
And the way that you get that is you open up Settingsin Windows 10 and you go to Update & Security.
And then on the left hand side you select For Developers,and make sure to choose Developer mode.
And if it asks you to save then go ahead and save.
I'm not sure, I can't remember that particular part.
But make sure that you have that set.
Visual Studio will probably give you an errorif you first run an application if you don'thave that setting set up, okay?Now this series of videosis about 15 or 16 hours long, it's fairly comprehensive.
And one of the most important new featuresof this training series is that I'm going to give youhomework assignments called challenges.
And I'll give you all the tools that you needto build an app to my specificationsand then I'm even going to give you the solutionto the challenge in the form of a videoin case you get stuck.
And that's a great way for you,and you should definitely do these challengeswhere you "get your hands dirty in the code"as I like to say it.
We're also going to build a little cheat sheetfor review purposes,and then you can reference it after you finishthe series of videos.
Feel free to add to the cheat sheetanything that you think might be usefulas you go forward and start building your own applications.
And then finally in the last half of the series,we're going to build four entire applicationsand even one of them for inclusion in the Windows Store.
Now these apps are going to show youhow to think like an app developerfrom concept through implementation.
And we'll use a variety of different techniques, and APIs,and tools and approaches to learn how tointeract with sensors on a given device.
How to access media libraries,how to access online services that provide weather updates.
And even allow us to tap into fun serviceslike Marvel comics web API,that allow us to retrieve back all their charactersand look through them and look through the artwork.
Now many of the videos in the series will have a zip fileassociated with them that contains the codethat I wrote while recording the video.
Or in the case of challenges like I just describeda moment ago,it'll contain the images that you need, any instructions,or any other files that'll be requiredin order to actually perform that challenge.
Now the file will be on the pagewhere you're currently watching the video,or where you originally downloaded the video from.
So please before you ask in the comments,"I can't find the download link,where's the download link, the download link!"Please hit Control + f on your keyboard in your web browserand search for the term "download".
If there's no link to download a filethen that particular video does not have files to download.
Please search for the term download first.
Now while this is a very inclusive set of videosI mean 15 to 16 hours is a lot of content to go through.
This is still really just an introduction.
I can't possibly show you everythingthat the Universal Windows Platform contains.
You should treat this as a gentle introduction only,but you should always refer back toMicrosoft's own documentation at the Windows Dev Centerfor comprehensive explanationhow to get the most out of Universal Windows Platform.
And you can access that at http://dev.windows.comNow remember that you can't just watcha screen cast tutorial training seriesthe way that you would watch a movie or a sitcom on TV.
You're going to need to become an active learner.
Don't be afraid to rewind or even rewatch an entire videoor a portion of the video if at firstsomething doesn't really make a lot of sense to you.
Or look at the documentation at the Windows Dev Centerat the link I just shared with you.
For more details surrounding the given topicthat we're discussing at that moment in the videos.
You learn best whenever you use differentmodalities to learn the same idea, the same content.
And ultimately the videos that I'm presenting are justone tool to help you realize your aspirationsof building apps for sale in the Windows Store.
Now, on a personal note if you like what I do hereplease visit me athttp://www.LearnVisualStudio.NETwhere I help beginners get theirfirst software development jobbuilding Windows and web appsinto world's best companies.
There are tons of challenge exercises thereand deeper insights into writing software usingVisual Studio, and C#, and ASP.NET and more.
Alright now finally I'd like to take a moment and thankthe hundreds of thousands of people who have watchedthe previous versions of this series.
And for those who took the time to actually tell Microsoftthat you wanted more of this type of training.
Your feedback made this happen,so thank you very much.
Also I want to thank Andy Wigley who patiently answeredall of the questions that I had and gave me a ton of advicewhile I was building this series.
I'm very thankful for his guidanceas I worked on these lessons.
And ultimately this series was championed primarilyby Clint Rutkas who has been involved in almost all of thevideo projects that I have worked on for Microsoft.
Without Clint, none of this would be possible.
So please reach out to him on Twitterand let him know how much you appreciate his good work.
Okay so enough setup.
You've got Visual Studio 2015 running on Windows 10and you've turned on Developer mode in Settingslike we looked at just a moment ago,and you're wondering what comes next.
Well we're going to get started in the very next video.
