1
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:08,619
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net</v>

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,451
and this is the challenge that I'm calling

3
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,680
the Stupendous Styles Challenge.

4
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:15,246
And you can see that I've got a

5
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,521
fictitious company I created called GoNuts.

6
00:00:17,522 --> 00:00:21,120
So my idea here is that someday when I'm burnt out

7
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,614
or when everybody discovers I'm a fraud (laughs),

8
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:27,686
I will open up a donut shop.

9
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:29,323
And I thought it'd be cool, you know, if you go up

10
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:32,226
and you pull up to some sort of a terminal

11
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:34,722
and you push in your order and then you drive around

12
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:37,479
and a robot delivers it into your car.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,419
That would be pretty cool.

14
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,716
So this is the kiosk application that I just came up with.

15
00:00:41,717 --> 00:00:43,284
It's just a layout, there's no real

16
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:47,106
e-commerce functionality, but let me walk you through it.

17
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,683
You can see that I have some navigation across the top.

18
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:50,913
I'll give you some specific instruction

19
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,190
about that in a moment.

20
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:55,693
And you can say, "Hey, I want, you know, so many,

21
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:59,884
"three glazed and four of the specials."

22
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:02,648
I'm going to go and order a dark

23
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,586
with sugar and cream.

24
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:09,399
And then let's make sure to pick that up,

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,858
let's see, tomorrow morning at,

26
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,824
I would say, like 9:30am, I should be there.

27
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,657
And then finally, hit the Complete

28
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:22,558
and I get this little ticket that tells me

29
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:24,520
which order number that I have.

30
00:01:24,521 --> 00:01:27,152
And you'll notice that, and I make a point of this,

31
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,254
that it's responsive insomuch that,

32
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,360
you can resize things and they mostly look good.

33
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,090
You see there's like this attractive little graphic here

34
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,808
on the right-hand side.

35
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:37,066
That I've got these,

36
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:40,157
even though different colors on the different Pages.

37
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:42,548
I've got the logo on the last Page.

38
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:44,522
There's a color logo.

39
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:46,055
What else can I show you here?

40
00:01:46,056 --> 00:01:46,856
Well, tell you what.

41
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,584
We have a bunch of resources, let me shut this down.

42
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:51,616
And let's talk about the requirements here.

43
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:55,888
You can see that I have this folder for you

44
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:56,860
to download from

45
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:58,796
wherever you're currently watching this video.

46
00:01:58,797 --> 00:02:00,685
Make sure you grab this because it has instructions

47
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,591
and all the resource files

48
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:03,483
that you're going to need to put this together.

49
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:05,155
So here's the instruction file,

50
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:07,222
and let's go through it really quick here.

51
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:09,683
You can see that, even if you're fast,

52
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:10,855
this is going to take you 45 minutes.

53
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:13,421
Like, it took me 50 minutes to solve this on camera,

54
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:15,987
and then I wanted to re-record it and split it up

55
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:18,088
because it was so long.

56
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,422
So don't get discouraged if it takes you a while,

57
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:22,407
just keep plugging away.

58
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,252
First of all, you want to use Styles as often as possible.

59
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:27,887
So if you see the same thing happening in multiple places,

60
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,244
if you see that you're applying the same

61
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:34,319
Margins and Colors and Fonts to more than one item,

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,596
then make a Style for it, ok?

63
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:38,116
That's really the point of this lesson, is to exercise that,

64
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,554
as well as to exercise some of the new Controls

65
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:43,212
that we just added on the last couple of videos.

66
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:44,455
So you're going to create five pages,

67
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,359
or you're obviously going to have the MainPage

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,822
and then four others.

69
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,993
And so let's talk about each of the Pages.

70
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:52,419
That "MainPage.xaml" will host the navigation buttons

71
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,486
at the very top, those black buttons.

72
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:57,125
And I talk about how to get that effect,

73
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,616
the black background, white text, 18 point font.

74
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,624
There will be an icon next to the text.

75
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,853
You want a gray border on the right that's two pixels.

76
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:08,952
Not sure if we've talked about how to apply a border.

77
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:11,413
Look through the properties of the button

78
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:14,885
to see if you can figure out how to give the border a color,

79
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:19,122
and how to give it a size on one side,

80
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:21,049
but not have any border on the rest,

81
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,789
on the other sides of the button, ok?

82
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,287
And then I give you a hint about how to create

83
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,390
those large buttons,

84
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:28,224
basically create a grid with four columns

85
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,686
and then set the Vertical and HorizontalAlignment

86
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:32,776
to Stretch on each of those buttons,

87
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:35,713
and that will fill up that entire area of the cell.

88
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,478
Alright, also on the "MainPage.xaml",

89
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,856
you want to split that bottom area

90
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:42,025
underneath the navigation, and you want to give it,

91
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:44,486
I guess I need to write this in here, let me add this in.

92
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:48,424
This, make that

93
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,457
100 pixels tall

94
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,046
for the buttons spot.

95
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,741
Probably should have re-phrased that.

96
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:58,057
I'll edit that off camera.

97
00:03:58,058 --> 00:04:00,693
So, you want to take the rest of the area

98
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,759
that's beneath the buttons,

99
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,450
and you want to split that area to 66% and 33%.

100
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,782
On the one side, you want to put the pages.

101
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,954
We'll load in the

102
00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,857
DonutPage, CoffeePage, SchedulePage, CompletePage.

103
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,656
And then on the right-hand side, the 33%,

104
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:19,988
we're going to put that neat little background image

105
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:21,858
of the coffee and the donuts there,

106
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,593
kind of to style it up a little bit.

107
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:25,323
And so whenever a user clicks on one of the

108
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:29,421
black navigation buttons at the top, it will load in

109
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:33,357
one of the other Pages into that bottom Frame area.

110
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,354
And so, you'll start with the DonutPage.

111
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:36,689
It's just going to host a white logo

112
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,885
and two slider controls.

113
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:39,022
Make sure you add some padding

114
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:40,984
around the sides of those controls.

115
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:43,353
Make sure that you can only order up to

116
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:48,218
two dozen of each type of donut, arbitrary limit there.

117
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,493
On the CoffeePage, little more involved.

118
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:52,153
There will be some logic on this page.

119
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,092
First of all, you'll notice that it had

120
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,194
a white logo and three buttons.

121
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,456
And each of the buttons are going to have a flyout menu,

122
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:02,521
and I give you the contents of those flyout menus here.

123
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:04,785
And whenever a selection is made,

124
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,119
you want to update a Label Control

125
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,119
that will display the, your selection from the TextBlock.

126
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:12,921
I don't know if I demoed that,

127
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,948
so let me run that again really quick here.

128
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,750
Let me show you what I mean.

129
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:21,492
Here I'm going to say, I want

130
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:25,323
Medium, Sugar, and Whole Milk.

131
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,750
But if I were to set the Coffee equal to None,

132
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,816
then it removes everything else,

133
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:32,651
because obviously you can't just order,

134
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:36,927
you can't just order a coffee,

135
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:38,053
you can't just order sweetener and cream

136
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,655
without a coffee, you know?

137
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:41,859
Although I've tried that before.

138
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:46,487
Ok, so next up, also, you'll need that color for the Brown,

139
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:47,822
because there's not a preset color

140
00:05:47,823 --> 00:05:51,526
that had exactly the right color that I was looking for.

141
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,718
Ok, number 7, the SchedulePage.

142
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,350
It had that TimePicker and DatePicker

143
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,451
that allowed me to choose the day and the time

144
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:00,088
where I want to pick up my order.

145
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,458
And you want to make sure to match the colors

146
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,118
to screenshots that I give you.

147
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,384
And let's go ahead and talk about those.

148
00:06:04,385 --> 00:06:06,776
Look, I give you the screenshots,

149
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:08,854
what everything should look like here in a bunch of images

150
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:10,816
so you don't have to keep the videos open.

151
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:15,216
So here's for the four Pages, A, B, C, and D there.

152
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:18,057
Alrighty, next up,

153
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:20,419
there is the CompletePage,

154
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,682
and it'll have the color version of the logo,

155
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:28,356
so, this file here, as well as the,

156
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:30,642
that ticket.jpg.

157
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:34,752
And let's, let's go to the view

158
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:37,091
and look at the large icons here,

159
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,316
that'll show us what we're looking at here.

160
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,116
Alright, so there's a bunch of icons.

161
00:06:41,117 --> 00:06:45,388
You can see they have the suffix, "-icon.png".

162
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,850
Here's that ticket icon, ticket graphic

163
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:49,391
and you're going to superimpose the word,

164
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:52,380
"Order 96" on top of it.

165
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:56,449
And there's the white-logo and the color-logo.

166
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,957
So, that should be all good.

167
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,106
Some general requirements.

168
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:03,253
The design should be responsive.

169
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:05,087
You notice when I was resizing,

170
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:09,116
things resized nicely, to an extent.

171
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,217
The navigation's at the top, they have to have that

172
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:13,853
border thickness of two and a gray border brush.

173
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:15,083
I think I already mentioned that earlier,

174
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,228
but I just want, bears repeating.

175
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,955
Most margins are 10 or 20, most font sizes are 18.

176
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,917
Try to match up as well as you can

177
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:24,860
if I haven't specified it.

178
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,888
Some of this is to your discretion,

179
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,792
whatever you come up with.

180
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:30,487
Make sure it just looks good.

181
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:32,983
You'll only need code behind for the navigation itself.

182
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:34,852
We're not talking about any other logic

183
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:38,486
unless I've noted above, ok, earlier in the document.

184
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:41,725
You have those images, A through D,

185
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,583
that will give you the various layouts

186
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:44,674
so you can look at it.

187
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:46,683
Also, you want to try to resolve this

188
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:50,110
without watching the next few videos.

189
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,473
where I think I'm going to split this up into like

190
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:54,016
four or five videos so you can get to

191
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,222
just the help that you need.

192
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:59,717
Only watch enough of the solution to get unstuck

193
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,621
and then continue on struggling.

194
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,292
Because struggling is how you learn.

195
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:05,382
And if you do wind up finishing it

196
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:07,182
and you've got an hour to spare,

197
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:10,746
you can watch how I solved the challenge

198
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,441
and the Styles that I created

199
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:16,957
and how I went about working in Visual Studio.

200
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:20,626
Probably will learn a little bit about maneuvering around,

201
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:25,119
but that is not necessarily an hour well spent,

202
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,385
just bear that in mind.

203
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,045
There's a lot of tedious work.

204
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:31,690
This isn't hard, it's just, there's a lot to it, ok?

205
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:32,956
Alright, well see what you come up with.

206
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,152
I know you can do it.

207
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:36,242
It's not that hard based on everything we've learned

208
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,482
up to this point, if you're paying attention.

209
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,481
Might have struggled a little bit,

210
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:40,183
may have to go back and look at

211
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:43,015
some of the work that we've done previously,

212
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:46,719
look at the cheat sheet, but I think you can do this, ok?

213
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,286
Alright, we'll see you in the next,

214
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,215
the next couple of videos for the solution.

215
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,277
Thanks.
