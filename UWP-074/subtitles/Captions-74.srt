1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,258
My goal in this video isto display characters in      

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:11,540
a list view, and so,to get to that point,      

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,110
there's gonna be a lot of steps.      

4
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:18,510
Honestly, we're not really allthat close, even though we have      

5
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,040
data from the Marvel API andwe deserialized it.      

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,710
But let's go ahead andget started.      

7
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:26,880
I wanna start by talking aboutthis method we were working with      

8
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:30,100
in a previous video,this GetCharacterList.      

9
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:31,328
There's a couple ofproblems with it.      

10
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,040
The first problem is thatthe name doesn't really describe      

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,695
what the what it does.      

12
00:00:35,696 --> 00:00:38,370
GetCharacterList should begiving me a list of characters.      

13
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,220
But really what it'sdoing is returning back      

14
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,850
the root object forthe entire object graph.      

15
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:47,240
So it's giving me thatcharacter data wrapper.      

16
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:48,300
And that would have to go in and      

17
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:52,100
find the charactersthat are associated      

18
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:56,950
with the character datacontainer, all right?      

19
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:59,115
And sothere's a lot of traversal.      

20
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,820
Furthermore, some ofthe characters that will be      

21
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,920
brought back won'thave image data.      

22
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,120
And soI want to filter those out.      

23
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,120
And there's a couple of othersteps too that I need to take in      

24
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:08,680
between there.      

25
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:11,673
What I really wanna dois be able to go from      

26
00:01:11,674 --> 00:01:14,940
the mainpage.xaml tothis Marvel facade.      

27
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,140
And I want to pass inan instance of an observable      

28
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:19,980
collection of character.      

29
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,791
So I have an observablecollection of character that I      

30
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,900
can bind to on my main page.      

31
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,650
And I want to pass thatobservable collection into      

32
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,920
a method here on myMarvel facade and      

33
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:34,880
let it add characters to it andso as we're adding characters      

34
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:38,830
to it, then the listwill grow and grow.      

35
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:42,420
So to accomplish that,what I'm wanna do is change,      

36
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:46,240
first of all, the name of thismethod from GetCharacterList to      

37
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:50,600
GetCharacterDataWrapper and      

38
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:54,050
then I'm gonna make thisa private helper method.      

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,968
Then I'm gonna call into that      

40
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:05,973
from a public static async      

41
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:14,180
Task calledPopulateMarvelCharacters.      

42
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:18,362
And then you're gonna passin an observable collection.      

43
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:25,326
A character, called      

44
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:31,902
marvelCharacters, so like that.      

45
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:38,979
All right, I'm gonna need toadd a using statement for      

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,480
the benefit ofthe ObservableCollection.      

47
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,977
And then what I want todo is make a call into,      

48
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:53,112
so var characters = actually,      

49
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:56,950
let me start back over again.      

50
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:03,490
Getcharacterdatawrapper =Getcharacterdatawrapper, okay.      

51
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:08,189
Then what I wanna dois var characters      

52
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,290
= characterdatawrapper dot.      

53
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,789
And so I'm gonna have totraverse through the character      

54
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,910
data container.      

55
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:19,046
And it has a propertycalled results,      

56
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:20,790
which is a list of characters.      

57
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,050
So let's go data.      

58
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,090
So characterwrapper.data.      

59
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,960
And then I seewhere the issue is.      

60
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:35,318
It's not giving me what Iexpect in IntelliSense because      

61
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,870
I didn't add the await keyword.      

62
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:39,950
And now, I should be ableto use IntelliSense and      

63
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,180
find what I'm looking for.      

64
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,013
Get data.results and      

65
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,780
that should give me backa list of characters.      

66
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:53,655
Now what I want to do is iteratethrough the list of characters,      

67
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:58,340
so foreach var character andcharacters.      

68
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:03,338
And I'm gonna add each characterto the marvelcharacters      

69
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:07,418
that I passed in,the observable collection of      

70
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:12,420
character, Like so.      

71
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,040
Whoops, character.      

72
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,560
There we go.      

73
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:25,140
Now in between here, I need tofilter out, so fIlter characters      

74
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:30,360
that are missingthumbnail images.      

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,420
And so what we'll do is this.      

76
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:42,920
If the character.thumbnailis not equal to null.      

77
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:53,120
And the character.thumbnail.pathis not equal to an empty string.      

78
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:57,570
And then from experience, I knowthere's one more situation.      

79
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,920
It's possible that a character'sthumbnail doesn't exist.      

80
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,480
It's possible thata character thumbnail,      

81
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:04,680
the path is empty string.      

82
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:10,030
But it's also possible thatthey return back this long URL      

83
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,340
that will actuallydisplay an image.      

84
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:15,770
But it's an imagenot available image.      

85
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:21,470
It has a little outline ofa character with not available.      

86
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:24,150
The text inside of it sothis what we'll do.      

87
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:29,881
character.thumbnail.path isnot equal      

88
00:05:29,882 --> 00:05:36,730
to this magic string,this URL that I have, okay?      

89
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,270
Now, before we go any further.      

90
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:43,128
I'm gonna take this magicstring, I'm gonna cut it out and      

91
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:44,910
I'll put it in a constant.      

92
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:51,028
private constant stringimagenotavailablepath =,      

93
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:55,949
and then we'll pastethat string in there,      

94
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,860
and I'll copy andpaste that here.      

95
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,850
So now we're pretty sure thatthe character has an image and      

96
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:07,550
we can use them in ourapplication, so at that point.      

97
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,440
Then we're gonna addthem to the application.      

98
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:13,740
Now, let's take a lookat the documentation.      

99
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:17,510
Go to the How-Tos section andlook at Images.      

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,600
If you take a look atthe thumbnail JSON,      

101
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:25,890
notice that there's a path andan extension property.      

102
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:27,210
That's not everything you need.      

103
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:29,080
There's missinginformation here, and      

104
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,660
you fill in the type of image or      

105
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:34,240
the size and the orientationof the image that you want.      

106
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:37,820
So if you scroll down, there'sthis Image Variants area here.      

107
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:42,350
And you can see that there'sa Portrait Aspect Ratio      

108
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,370
where you have a portrait,square or standard, and      

109
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,610
then the landscape right?      

110
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:52,620
And so then and even within thatyou had different sized images.      

111
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,475
So for our purposes, we'regonna use a portrait small,      

112
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:59,360
that'll be a little image nextto the name of the character      

113
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:02,560
in the list of characters thatwe're working on right now.      

114
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:04,200
And then, once you clickon a character and      

115
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:06,360
you see all the detailsof that character,      

116
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:09,740
then we're going to displaythe standard extra large.      

117
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:14,110
So what we're gonna needto do then is to go      

118
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:17,690
over to our Model's Folder, openup the CharacterDataWrapper,      

119
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,210
and look at the Thumbnail class.      

120
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:22,890
And what I want to do is add twoadditional properties that will      

121
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:26,340
be ignored while we'redeserializing into the object      

122
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:32,570
graph but will be useful now aswe're populating a observable      

123
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:35,390
collection of charactersthat we intend to bind to.      

124
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:39,400
So I'm gonna go prop, prop,prop tab, tab, string tab tab.      

125
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:44,368
Small enter, enter, prop,tab, tab, string tab,      

126
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,960
tab, large enter, enter.      

127
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:50,695
So we have two new properties,and I'm gonna populate those      

128
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:53,340
properties here insidethe if statement.      

129
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:58,412
So, we'll gocharacter.thumbnail.small      

130
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:01,143
= string.format, and      

131
00:08:01,144 --> 00:08:06,740
then I'm gonna need tokinda follow that pattern.      

132
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:12,503
Where we had the path/ then theimage that we wanted to use and      

133
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:15,554
that's gonna be a standard, so      

134
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:20,413
a square,small size dot andthen whatever the file      

135
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:25,160
extension is that theygive us passed in, right?      

136
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:29,726
And sothen we'll just enter those      

137
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:35,400
replaceable values,giving it the path.      

138
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:42,000
And then also the extension,      

139
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:44,640
like that.      

140
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:47,520
And we're gonna dothe exact same thing for      

141
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:49,840
the large version.      

142
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:53,930
So, character.thumbnail.small,let's go large.      

143
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:57,600
Equals, andhere we want to go the portrait.      

144
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,760
And then, we want to change,they don't have a large,      

145
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,290
they have an extra large.      

146
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,930
That should be aboutthe right size for us.      

147
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:10,210
All right, great.      

148
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:13,500
Very good.      

149
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,559
Now that we haveall this in place,      

150
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,130
I think we're ready toopen up the MainPage.xml.      

151
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:23,750
And let me get ridof my webcam here so      

152
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:24,990
you can see the entire screen.      

153
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,850
Let me go back so      

154
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:28,910
you can look at the righthand side of the code here.      

155
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:31,230
You can pause it andcatch up with me.      

156
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:35,048
And then also, you can pause ithere and take a look at this      

157
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:39,346
URL, or you can just look at thesource code associated with this      

158
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:42,550
snapshot, this snapshot in time,all right?      

159
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:44,297
Back to the MainPage.xml.      

160
00:09:44,298 --> 00:09:48,792
Let me rid of that,and let's open up      

161
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:54,014
the MainPage.xml.cs andwhat I'm gonna      

162
00:09:54,015 --> 00:10:00,265
want to do is to createa property so prop tab, tab.      

163
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:06,822
This is gonna bean ObservableCollectionCharacter      

164
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:10,418
called MarvelCharacters.      

165
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:13,300
And I'm gonna need to adda using statement for      

166
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:17,500
the ObservableCollection,and a using statement for      

167
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:22,140
the character,all right very good.      

168
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:24,900
Then I'm gonna want to, in theinitializer for the main page,      

169
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:28,370
I'm gonna create a newinstance of Marvel character.      

170
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:33,729
So MarvelCharacters = new ObservableCollection(Character-      

171
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,200
>().      

172
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:34,970
So far so good.      

173
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,180
Now, we're not gonna havea button click event, and      

174
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:39,790
we really don't need anyof this stuff anymore.      

175
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,867
So, I'm gonna stripall that out, and      

176
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:41,692
we'll come back to it later.      

177
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:46,855
In the main pages on XAML I'mgoing to get rid of the button,      

178
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:50,277
and I'm gonna removethe background.      

179
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:56,065
And inside of here, what Iwanna do is use that technique      

180
00:10:56,066 --> 00:11:00,870
that we learned aboutearlier in this series,      

181
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,565
where we have contenton the left and      

182
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:08,840
content on the rightin a wide layout.      

183
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:10,650
But when the layoutbecomes smaller,      

184
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:13,310
we're gonna take the contenton the right and      

185
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:19,580
move it beneath the maincontent on the left.      

186
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,550
And so to accomplishthat what we'll do is,      

187
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,930
we're gonna createa four by four grid.      

188
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:28,802
So we'll go Grid.RowDefinitions,and      

189
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:31,350
we'll create tworow definitions.      

190
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,630
And we'll set the heightof the first one to *,      

191
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:43,530
and the height ofthe second one to Auto.      

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,194
And we'll modify some ofthis information, especially      

193
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:54,584
the column information, wheneverwe add the adaptive triggers.      

194
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:57,892
So, ColumnDefinitions.      

195
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:08,314
And we're gonna make the firstcolumn definition Auto, and      

196
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:12,040
then the second columndefinition width = *.      

197
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,170
Now, there's one last thing thatI wanna do, and that's add a row      

198
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:23,430
definition that willcontain attribution text.      

199
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:25,270
We'll talk about thatin just a little bit.      

200
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:30,900
But I'm gonna set the heightof this last row = 30 for now.      

201
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:31,678
We can adjust that later.      

202
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,895
All right, so, to begin with,      

203
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:37,603
on the left-hand side we'regonna have a ListView.      

204
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:39,203
On the right-hand side,      

205
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:42,852
we're gonna have a grid thatwill contain all the details.      

206
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:46,020
So we're gonna follow thisdesign pattern called master      

207
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:48,726
detail where you have a listof items on the left,      

208
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,640
you select an item on the left,and      

209
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:53,445
it shows the details aboutthat item on the right.      

210
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:57,790
So we're going to give this thename, MasterListView, and we'll      

211
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,440
refer to it like that throughoutthe remainder of the series.      

212
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:01,940
And then,      

213
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:06,150
we're gonna call this grid'sname DetailGrid, and there will      

214
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,858
be a bunch of other stuff thatwill goes inside of this.      

215
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:10,980
Finally, I'm gonnaadd a text block and      

216
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:15,250
I'm gonna set the name of thatto, well I don't even know if I      

217
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,590
need to set a name, let me justset the text to = Attribution,      

218
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:21,910
we'll come back to thatin just a little while.      

219
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:26,825
And I'll makethe VerticalAlignment = Center,      

220
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:30,928
and the HorizontalAlignment= Center.      

221
00:13:34,308 --> 00:13:36,080
All right,let's get that up here, and      

222
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,530
move these guys downtheir own level.      

223
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:42,430
And finally what I want todo is add a ProgressRing.      

224
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:46,080
And that ProgressRing, we'regoing to initialize it whenever      

225
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:48,560
we're making a callinto the Marvel API.      

226
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,660
Because it could take a while,and then we will hide it      

227
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:57,150
whenever we've gottenthe information that we need.      

228
00:13:57,151 --> 00:14:02,353
So what I'll do is, I'm gonnagive it a name cuz I need      

229
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:07,455
to access it programmatically,MyProgressRing.      

230
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,603
And I'll make the width 100,and the height 100.      

231
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:14,653
And then I'm gonna setthe Foreground = Gray.      

232
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:21,464
And we're gonna makethe ColumnSpan=2,      

233
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:26,840
and the RowSpan=3, like so.      

234
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,482
So it's gonna bedead-center no matter what.      

235
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:30,345
In fact, I'm gonna go ahead and      

236
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,833
set theVerticalAlignment=Center, and      

237
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:35,470
the HorizontalAlignment=Centeras well.      

238
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:36,074
Nice.      

239
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:42,090
Okay, so we should be able touse that whenever we start up.      

240
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:46,512
In fact, when we startup let's go ahead and      

241
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:49,627
add a loaded event to our page.      

242
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:53,417
So we're gonna handle itin a Page_Loaded even,      

243
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:55,681
in our MainPage.xaml.cs.      

244
00:14:55,682 --> 00:15:02,140
And here's where we'llwind up calling into our MarvelFacade.PopulateMarvelChar-      

245
00:15:02,141 --> 00:15:03,050
acters, and      

246
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,953
we'll pass inthe MarvelCharacters,      

247
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,270
All right, like so.      

248
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:16,930
Now this is awaitable, andthere's one thing that I wanna      

249
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:19,110
do to this while I'mthinking about it right now.      

250
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:23,760
The pattern forcreating your own awaitable      

251
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:28,260
methods is to addthe suffix async.      

252
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:33,790
So for example, here we have ourGetCharacterDataWrapper, and      

253
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:39,940
it's an async method returninga task of CharacterDataWrapper.      

254
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:44,221
It's a pattern to add thatsuffix so people know that      

255
00:15:44,222 --> 00:15:47,890
this is intended tobe an awaitable task.      

256
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:52,120
So, we're changing the name toGetCharacterDataWrapperAsync and      

257
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm gonna hit controlperiod on my keyboard to      

258
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,930
open up the refactoringmenu in IntelliSense and      

259
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:01,490
it's going to then remain.      

260
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:04,367
Everywhere I called in toGetCharacterDataWrapper,      

261
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:07,500
it's gonna rename it toGetCharacterDataWrapperAsync.      

262
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,110
And notice that now every callto it, which we made the call      

263
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:19,750
right here, in our code, noticethat it has renamed it for us.      

264
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:22,340
And we'll do the same thingwith PopulateMarvelCharacters.      

265
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:25,590
I'm gonna add the Asynckeyword on the end and      

266
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:27,795
then hit Ctrl+ on my keyboard,and      

267
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:30,655
I'm gonna choose the refactoringto rename that as well.      

268
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,785
And so now,in our MainPage.xaml.cs,      

269
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:37,015
it should have the new name andit does.      

270
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:40,045
Of course now it's awaitable,so we're gonna have to call      

271
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,820
awaits, that means thatwe're no longer void.      

272
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:51,060
Or actually, let's just do this,async, like that, great.      

273
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:55,260
And the next thing that we'regonna do is, let's go ahead      

274
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:58,750
while I'm thinking aboutthis and go MyProgressRing,      

275
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:04,570
we're going to setthe IsActive = true.      

276
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:08,840
As we're loading,MyProgressRing.Visibility will      

277
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,910
also equal Visibility.Visible.      

278
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:14,420
And then the oppositewill be true once we've      

279
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,540
successfully populatedthe Marvel characters and      

280
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,010
called into ourPopulateMarvelCharacterAsync.      

281
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:26,703
So we'll set IsActive = falseand then Visibility.Collapsed.      

282
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:29,930
All right, so that should work.      

283
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,500
Now, in the MainPage.xaml,      

284
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,350
I want to work primarilywith the ListView.      

285
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:38,919
And I'm going to DataBind,to that Marvel characters.      

286
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:46,930
Let's set the ItemsSource=x:Bind      

287
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:53,941
MarvelCharacters, like that?      

288
00:17:53,942 --> 00:18:01,070
And then we're gonna need toadd a ListView.ItemTemplate and      

289
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:04,836
inside of thata DataTemplate and      

290
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:09,690
I'm gonna need to adda DataType, right?      

291
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:13,560
And so at this point I need tocome back up to the top, and      

292
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,605
I need to add a name space so      

293
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:24,983
xmlns:data=using:HeroExplorer.M-      

294
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:26,710
odels.      

295
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:30,710
So now, I can use the DataTypeCharacter, like that.      

296
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:39,610
And inside of my DataTemplate,I want to use a StackPanel and      

297
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:43,880
orient the items horizontally,and      

298
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:47,534
the items will be an Image anda TextBlock, and      

299
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:50,770
the TextBlock will containthe name of the character.      

300
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,190
So I'm going to go ahead andset the text attribute      

301
00:18:57,191 --> 00:19:01,370
equal to an x:Bind statement,and we'll use the name.      

302
00:19:01,371 --> 00:19:03,810
And the Image,we're gonna use a Source.      

303
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,877
And we'll setthe x:Bind equal to      

304
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:14,360
the thumbnail.small, like that.      

305
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,170
All right, let me build it.      

306
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:18,064
And we're gonna give it a whirl.      

307
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,320
Okay, great we've gotdata in a data bound.      

308
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:26,110
Now, I'm not really crazyabout where it stuck      

309
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:27,210
the attribution there.      

310
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:28,580
I think I missed something.      

311
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,606
In fact,I know I missed something.      

312
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:34,881
Let's set the details grid,      

313
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:41,038
Grid.Column = 1,and Grid.Row = 0.      

314
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,462
And we're gonnadynamically modify these      

315
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:53,280
whenever we add adaptivelayout to the application.      

316
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:56,015
We have to do this tothe TextBlock as well.      

317
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:58,234
That's why it wound up kindof in the middle there.      

318
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:03,601
So Grid.ColumnSpan = 2 andthe Grid.Row.      

319
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:07,687
Will equal two.      

320
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,450
Now let's save that and run it.      

321
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,200
Okay, now a couple of things.      

322
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,771
I'm not crazy aboutthe frame counter [LAUGH].      

323
00:20:24,772 --> 00:20:26,380
We'll get rid of that.      

324
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:27,940
Not crazy about theselittle squares.      

325
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:29,220
They're just not inspiring.      

326
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:31,050
I've got a better idea there and      

327
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:33,700
then let's tackleattribution as well.      

328
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,950
If you take a look atthe Marvel API and      

329
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:38,500
you go up to the top intothe How-To section and      

330
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:41,510
you select Attribution& Rate Limits,      

331
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:44,160
we're gonna learn two importantpieces of information.      

332
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,360
Let's scroll down andlook at attribution.      

333
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:49,950
It says that every time youdisplay any information from      

334
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:50,850
the Marvel Comics API,      

335
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:55,440
you need to use the texton every screen or webpage.      

336
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:59,230
So it's this data providedby Marvel, copyright.      

337
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:01,700
Now they didn't update this for2015 but      

338
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,760
I know that that's their intent.      

339
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:06,670
If you take a look at I'm justgonna copy this to my clipboard      

340
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,020
and we'll come back toyou just a moment here.      

341
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:13,020
If we take a look at theinteractive documentation and      

342
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,780
making sure I'm loggedin here and I am.      

343
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,950
Let's open up characters and      

344
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:24,720
let me just bring back likea two characters and try it out.      

345
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:27,890
If you take a look atwhat's brought back,      

346
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:29,890
there is attributiontext that's provided.      

347
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:31,850
It's almost identical,it's just 2015.      

348
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:35,360
So, I'm going to hard codein it in my application but      

349
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:41,310
ideally you would pull that fromthat top level root object,      

350
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:45,040
the data character wrapper,okay?      

351
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,830
So I'm gonna go back here and      

352
00:21:46,831 --> 00:21:51,870
just hard code this text andchange 2014 to 2015.      

353
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:57,410
So textblock text equals dataprovided by Marvel period and      

354
00:21:57,411 --> 00:22:03,283
then the copyright symbol 2015Marvel and we might address      

355
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:09,020
the date later or just pullfrom our call-out to Marvel.      

356
00:22:09,021 --> 00:22:09,870
All right, so far so good.      

357
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,390
Now, I said that I hadan idea for the image.      

358
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:17,030
I wasn't really crazy abouthow we went about it.      

359
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,540
What I'm gonna do isactually put every image      

360
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,650
inside an ellipse.      

361
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,310
So I'm gonna use the ellipse tokind of define the boundaries      

362
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:27,710
and inside of that I'm gonnause a different brush.      

363
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:29,500
Not a solid colored brush.      

364
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:33,630
Not a gradient color brush,but rather an image brush and      

365
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:36,020
the image brushwill have the image      

366
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,900
that will bind to fromthe character object.      

367
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:41,880
So we'll just start off withan ellipse, easy enough, right.      

368
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:46,221
Width equals 45 andheight equals 45 and      

369
00:22:46,222 --> 00:22:51,854
then inside of that I'mgonna use <ellipse.fill> and      

370
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:55,390
I'm gonna put an <imagebrush>.      

371
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:59,872
I'm gonna set the ImageSource      

372
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:04,353
equal to a binding statement so      

373
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:08,670
x:Bind thumbnail.small.      

374
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:11,610
Spell it right.      

375
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:18,370
Like that andI missed a quote mark there.      

376
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:19,230
What am I missing?      

377
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,256
And I missed a quote mark there.      

378
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:23,802
Wow, I'm slipping.      

379
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,520
Okay, let's try this again.      

380
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,067
Attribution text looks good,      

381
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,480
still gotta get rid ofthat frame counter.      

382
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,120
Okay, so now look atthe effect that we get here.      

383
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:40,080
There's a a circle.      

384
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:41,420
Very nice.      

385
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,910
The next thing that I wanna do,well,      

386
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:45,020
let's do a couple of things.      

387
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:51,150
I'm gonna add a little bit of,let's put like,      

388
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:56,150
for example, the verticalalignment here equals center.      

389
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:00,930
I'm gonna use font size equalssomething a little bit larger      

390
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:06,750
like 18 and then I'm alsogonna add a margin equal to      

391
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:13,910
ten pixels, well yeah, ten,no, ten pixels to the left      

392
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,130
and overall I wannaadd a little margin.      

393
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,360
Ten from the left, the five fromthe top, zero from the right,      

394
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:30,670
and five from the bottombetween each item.      

395
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:32,150
We'll see what that gives us.      

396
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,050
All right,I like that a lot better.      

397
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:42,610
Very nice.All right and      

398
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:46,140
then the last thing I'm gonnado for this video is actually      

399
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:50,470
once and for all vanquish mynemesis, the frame counter.      

400
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,730
Bam.      

401
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,990
Okay, all right solet's stop right there.      

402
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:58,590
I think we madeplenty of progress.      

403
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:03,390
Let's, in the next lesson we'regoing to display the details for      

404
00:25:03,391 --> 00:25:07,390
the character by selecting oneof the characters in the list      

405
00:25:07,391 --> 00:25:08,270
view, okay?      

406
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:09,850
We'll start back therein the next video.      

407
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:10,430
See you there.      

408
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:11,210
Thanks.
