1
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:08,029
<v ->Okay, so we're making great progress here.</v>

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,790
The next thing we want to do is evaluate

3
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:11,980
what the user clicks on.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,510
The song is playing, they're going to choose an album cover,

5
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:19,350
and we want to evaluate the click.

6
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,069
Is it the song that's currently selected?

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,109
If yes, then we want to award them points,

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,150
and we want to display

9
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:32,940
a "correct" symbol in place of that album art.

10
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:35,286
However, if it's not correct,

11
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:37,166
we want to deduct points from their score

12
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,556
and then display the "incorrect" icon.

13
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:43,486
These icons are available for the download that

14
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:45,986
is associated with this video.

15
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:48,506
So, wherever you typically download the source code from,

16
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,946
those two files, the "correct" and "incorrect" PNGs

17
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:53,616
will be there as well.

18
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:56,526
Ok, so let's go ahead and get started here,

19
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:59,796
and we're going to evaluate whatever the user clicked on.

20
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:03,387
And we know that will happen

21
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:07,197
here in the SongGridView_ItemClick event.

22
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,196
So, the first thing we'll want to do is

23
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:16,137
we're going to ignore clicks

24
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:18,816
when the music isn't playing.

25
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:21,486
When the music...

26
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:24,506
When we are in cooldown.

27
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:29,999
So if not playing music,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,179
then just return.

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,240
This isn't the right time to be clicking on this

30
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:39,189
part of the application's user interface.

31
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:42,420
However, if we are currently playing music,

32
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:45,320
then we want the current animation

33
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,439
to pause for a moment.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,050
So pause the playback of the countdown animation.

35
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:54,653
And as far as the music is concerned, MyMediaElement,

36
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:57,889
we're going to stop the playback of the music.

37
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,630
Ok, so that should fix that problem.

38
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,320
Next up, we want to determine what was actually clicked on,

39
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:07,620
so we're going to go var song equals the ClickedItem

40
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:12,590
in the Grid and we'll cast that to an instance of Song.

41
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:18,617
And now we want to find

42
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:21,337
what the correct song was.

43
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:24,283
So what did we pick randomly

44
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,883
before we started this round?

45
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:28,393
Well...

46
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,433
Here we want to...

47
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:39,212
actually get access to

48
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:42,114
the correct song.

49
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:48,694
So FirstOrDefault where

50
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,933
Selected equals True.

51
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:57,971
And now we want to evaluate,

52
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:03,791
so if the song...

53
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,670
You know what we're going to need to do?

54
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:10,600
We're going to need to compare apples to apples, I'm afraid.

55
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,789
Well, maybe not.

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,578
That's going to be a pickle.

57
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,558
We'll see if it works.

58
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:23,758
If the song, in fact, just to kinda get this squared

59
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,979
in my mind,

60
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,489
clickedSong...

61
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,938
Alright, so if the clicked song...

62
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,537
Yeah, I should, may not even have to do any of this,

63
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:35,020
honestly.

64
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:40,240
So if clickedSong.Selected,

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,210
then what we want to do is...

66
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:52,047
set the clickedSong

67
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:54,782
.AlbumCover

68
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:58,992
.SetSourceAsync...

69
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,832
and we're going to need a FileStream here.

70
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,122
So I should be able to just do what I did earlier

71
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:10,832
with await file.OpenAsync...

72
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,051
Why can't I do that?

73
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,458
Oh, I see.

74
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:19,999
Okay. Let me start over.

75
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:25,198
Let me get a reference to the correct URI,

76
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,679
so let's go...

77
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:34,898
var uri

78
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,498
equals new Uri

79
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:43,408
and we'll need to get at the correct PNG,

80
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,947
so let me just copy these into my Assets folder,

81
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,206
make sure I do that first of all,

82
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:48,996
assets...

83
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,616
Alright, great.

84
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,756
So, back here.

85
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,346
Sorry for the indecision,

86
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:57,656
just this is the nature of how this sort of thing goes.

87
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:04,826
So "ms-appx:///assets

88
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:08,411
"/correct.png."

89
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:10,532
Alright, so we got that,

90
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:12,902
and then what I want to do is

91
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,211
well, let's get that file, so...

92
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:23,212
"StorageFile file equals

93
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:26,346
"StorageFile

94
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:33,046
".GetFileFromApplication

95
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,806
"UriAsync"

96
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:37,086
and I'm going to give it the URI,

97
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,966
so that should give me a reference to that file

98
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,337
in the file system.

99
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:47,597
So "var fileStream

100
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:51,127
"equals file.OpenAsync"

101
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:57,174
access mode Read, like that,

102
00:05:57,175 --> 00:06:00,874
and then what I want to do is

103
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,111
clickedSong.AlbumCover.SetSourceAsync

104
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:08,158
.SetSourceAsync()

105
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:13,158
to that fileStream

106
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,128
like that.

107
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:19,140
Alright, so I've got lots of problems here.

108
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:24,221
First problem I think I have here

109
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:27,940
is that I've got an async and I need to do this.

110
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:31,380
So, await that and then we'll have to add

111
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:33,730
async here.

112
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:36,331
Great.

113
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:41,110
And then SetSourceAsync(), why are you not happy?

114
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:44,290
Oh, we've gotta await you as well.

115
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:47,930
Great.

116
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,790
And what's the problem here?

117
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:54,411
Ah. Okay.

118
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,250
It's actually that problem.

119
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,810
There we go. Nice.

120
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,550
And this should actually be selected.

121
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:09,360
If the clickedSong is selected, then we want to change that,

122
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:12,970
but otherwise we want to do the reverse.

123
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:17,010
And for now, I'm just going to go ahead and do this,

124
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,860
where I see an opportunity to kinda consolidate that

125
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:22,780
into fewer lines of code,

126
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,141
but for right now I'm just going to copy and paste

127
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:27,020
just to see if the logic and the selections

128
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:29,660
of what I'm working with here

129
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,681
will actually work,

130
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:32,350
so let's try it.

131
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:38,270
My concern is that we're going to lose our connection

132
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,180
to what we're binding to,

133
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:42,560
so when we click it....

134
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,550
Hold on.

135
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,580
When we click it,

136
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:47,420
we're only clicking a copy of the object,

137
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,872
not part of the collection that we've bound to.

138
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,690
It'll make sense here in a moment.

139
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:53,450
(music plays)

140
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:57,000
That was an odd coincidence,

141
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,450
but we'll go with it.

142
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:06,611
(music plays).

143
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:08,371
Okay.

144
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:10,280
So you can see, I think we've got it working.

145
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:19,310
(music plays)

146
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:22,650
Okay. Great.

147
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,540
Now, I'm not entirely sure.

148
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,630
We're going to have to do some more work here.

149
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:30,420
But lemmie get rid of all of that,

150
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:34,901
and I think what I want to do here is

151
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,430
Uri uri like that,

152
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:45,520
and then all we'll do is just grab off the URI like so

153
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:50,312
and then we'll do this like so.

154
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:56,012
And get rid of that, great.

155
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,952
This should work, still.

156
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,082
See how I was able to consolidate all that?

157
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,661
Alright, and then the other thing I need

158
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:10,562
is a score, so let's go ahead and go

159
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:15,851
int _totalScore

160
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:21,202
We'll set it equal to zero initially,

161
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:24,642
and what we want to do is

162
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,562
go back to where we were, yeah, here,

163
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:31,560
and I want to

164
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:35,469
grab the score here

165
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:39,242
so let's go score equals

166
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:43,289
MyProgressBar.Value

167
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:50,414
And I'm just going to make sure that it's an int.

168
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:55,904
So that's, if we get it right, I want a positive score,

169
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,864
but if we get it wrong what I'm going to do

170
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,464
is kinda the opposite.

171
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,556
So ... score equals MyProgressBar.Value

172
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,676
MyProgressBar.Value

173
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:10,440
And let's go ahead and do this

174
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:13,321
like so.

175
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:17,680
And I'm going to subtract points if you get it wrong.

176
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:23,721
Oh, actually, multiply that times minus one.

177
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:28,070
This might not be the most fair scoring system,

178
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:30,170
but it's just going to illustrate

179
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,430
how I'm going to go about this.

180
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,672
We can always fix this later.

181
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:37,462
So we're going to set totalScore plus-equals

182
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:41,592
whatever the score was from that right there.

183
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:51,373
Alright, and I think also, while we're here

184
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:54,412
what I want to do is set some things about,

185
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:59,350
so the ResultTextBlock.Text

186
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,700
equals string.Format score,

187
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,990
total score, after...

188
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,770
So here what I want to do is show, first of all, the score.

189
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:34,030
Then I want to show the round.

190
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,930
And then I want to show the total score like that.

191
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,099
So then let's go with TitleTextBlock.Text

192
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,259
equals String.Format

193
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,828
and oh, you know what we need do?

194
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:51,609
So here's what I want to do

195
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,548
is "Correct Song"

196
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,797
but we've only determined whether our song

197
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:01,337
is correct or incorrect,

198
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:05,106
not whether it's, which one is the correct one.

199
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:05,876
So let me do this.

200
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:10,777
var correctSong equals

201
00:12:12,546 --> 00:12:15,494
let's get all of our songs,

202
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,614
FirstOrDefault

203
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:23,431
where Selected

204
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:25,041
equals true

205
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:30,911
So that should give me the correct song

206
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:33,102
and now I can do something like this.

207
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:37,451
correctSong

208
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:41,831
.Title

209
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:48,016
and then the ArtistTextBlock.Text equals String.Format

210
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,316
"Performed by" ...

211
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:59,293
correctSong.Artist

212
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:05,224
And then ... AlbumTextBlock.Text

213
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:10,902
equals string.Format

214
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:15,902
"on album"

215
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:21,516
and then correctSong.Album

216
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,206
Now, what I want to do is

217
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,997
whenever we...

218
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,946
That's when we start the cooldown, we'll see that.

219
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:39,363
But when we restart,

220
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,712
prepare the next round,

221
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:45,281
where do I do that at?

222
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,911
I want to clear all that out.

223
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,931
Populate SongList, pick random songs...

224
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:55,381
And my code is honestly unwieldy.

225
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,701
I should be splitting this up into other classes

226
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:59,081
and things like that,

227
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:02,251
but I'm not going to do that just yet.

228
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:05,748
Okay.

229
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,228
I'll worry about that part later.

230
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,568
I gotta think about that a little bit more

231
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:10,958
when we're going to reset that.

232
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,509
But at any rate, I need to set the state of these songs

233
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,169
because now we're kinda done working with them,

234
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,310
so the clickedSong, I should be able to set

235
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:26,189
its Used property equal to true,

236
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,249
and then I should be able to set the correctSong,

237
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,859
the Selected is now false.

238
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,469
And then I want to make sure that we don't

239
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,689
reuse it because it's already been clicked on,

240
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,119
and that means it has either a checkmark or an X,

241
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,549
and so the album cover won't be visible anymore,

242
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,869
so we want to make sure that it's been used

243
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,379
and we don't accidentally choose it again.

244
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,809
So finally, what I want to do here is do a check.

245
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,909
I'm only going to run this five times,

246
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,719
so if the round is greater than or equal to five,

247
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,729
then I'm going to do some end-game cleanup.

248
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:17,249
Otherwise, if it's not, then I want to start

249
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,259
the cooldown process again.

250
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,129
Here what I'm going to do is set

251
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,217
the InstructionTextBlock.Text

252
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,427
equals String.Format

253
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,507
and I'm going to say "Game Over, you scored"

254
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:40,550
and then put the total score in there,

255
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:42,950
_totalScore

256
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:49,760
And then the PlayAgainButton's visiblity,

257
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:53,750
I'm going to set that equal to Visible.

258
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,650
Okay, so we'll show that.

259
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:02,650
And that should do it.

260
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:06,430
So let's go ahead and now see what we get ourselves here.

261
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:20,150
(music plays)

262
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,561
Hmm, thought I knew that one.

263
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,620
But you can see I scored minus 60.

264
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:29,220
"Catch Me When I Fall," Storm Coming,

265
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,730
so it was off that album.

266
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:35,810
(music plays)

267
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:40,221
And I don't know any of these songs,

268
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:41,401
they're all made up,

269
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:44,962
so that should have been "Humble and Proud,"

270
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:45,840
should have been off that album,

271
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:48,631
so these two should not be selected in the future.

272
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:53,550
(music plays)

273
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:56,160
Hey, I got one right.

274
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:58,020
That was "Brian Plays a Hot Guitar,"

275
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:01,940
Inclement Weather, on the Longhorn album.

276
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:03,630
Great.

277
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:09,310
(music plays)

278
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:12,050
I got that one wrong, too.

279
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:23,990
(music plays)

280
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:25,900
Hey, I got one accidentally right.

281
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:27,160
So I played five rounds,

282
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:29,810
I scored negative 50, and I can play again.

283
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:31,080
Now, this doesn't do anything,

284
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:34,840
but we'll have to come back to that, then,

285
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:38,710
in the next video,

286
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:41,720
so I think that's all I really wanted to cover

287
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,720
in this video.

288
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:43,781
Let's go ahead and stop it here

289
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:46,470
and then I can re-group and figure out where we go

290
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:48,090
from here.
