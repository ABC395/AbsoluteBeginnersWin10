00:00:06,244 --> 00:00:09,756
Hi, I'm Bob Tabor, withwww.learnvisualstudio.net and      

2
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:11,443
this is the solution video for      

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:15,400
the challenge I callthe Hamburger Heaven Challenge.      

4
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:16,770
Without further adolet's go ahead and      

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,720
get started, make sure thatyou're only watching this video      

6
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,840
after you've struggleda little bit.      

7
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,590
So I'm gonna go ahead andcreate a project.      

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,498
And we're gonna make sure it isa blank app universal windows      

9
00:00:27,499 --> 00:00:28,475
template project.      

10
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:35,219
I'm gonna call thisHamburgerHeavenChallenge.      

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,743
All right and I'm just gonnafollow the instructions as they      

12
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:41,430
appear in our littleinstruction file here.      

13
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:44,140
So let me open that up as welland I'll keep it off here to      

14
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:49,368
the left side and I can get toit pretty easily from there. Okay.      

15
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:50,270
So, one of the first      

16
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:53,810
instructions was that you gonnaneed to find the two images      

17
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,790
that are availablecalled food png and      

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,950
financial png andadd them to your assets folder.      

19
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,530
Great. Okay. So      

20
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:02,870
here's what I'm gonna do isactually gonna get rid of that.      

21
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:05,861
I have them on my desktop atthe moment and I'm going to      

22
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:09,330
select them both and drag anddrop them into my assets folder.      

23
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:11,965
So far, so good.      

24
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:16,853
All right, and next up saidthat you have to add two pages      

25
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:21,140
to your app, Food.xaml andFinancial.xaml.      

26
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,610
And each of these willhost single image control.      

27
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:27,190
We're gonna set the Source tofood and financial, great.      

28
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:27,959
That's easy enough.      

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,836
So with the project selectedhere, I'm going to go to Project      

30
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:34,978
> Add New Item, make surethat I add a blank page.      

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,196
Gonna call the firstone Financial.      

32
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:42,189
And then I'm gonnaadd another one and      

33
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,921
it's gonna be called Food.      

34
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:54,959
All right, and let's goahead and get rid of that.      

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,661
And inside of here, I'm gonnaactually get rid of that.      

36
00:01:58,662 --> 00:02:01,715
I'm gonna add an image control.      

37
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:07,519
I'm gonna set the source equalto Assets, and this is food.png,      

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,223
and then I'm also gonna setthe the VerticalAlignment="Top"      

39
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:18,212
just to make sure that it buttsitself up against the top.      

40
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:21,311
That's all I should haveto do for Food.xaml.      

41
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,082
And then we'll do the samething for Financial.xaml.      

42
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,544
Get rid of that.      

43
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:30,669
Get rid of that Background.      

44
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,124
Add an Image.      

45
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,633
Set the Source.      

46
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:43,498
Equal to Assets/Financial.png,and      

47
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,340
the VerticalAlignment to Top.      

48
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,960
All right, so far so good.      

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,352
All right,let's get rid of that.      

50
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:56,321
And actually while I'm here andI have the App.xaml.cs I'm      

51
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:59,155
going to go ahead andrip out frame counter.      

52
00:03:02,835 --> 00:03:05,597
All right, good.      

53
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,514
All right, instruction number 3,you must create an app featuring      

54
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:10,590
hamburger style navigationusing a SplitView.      

55
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,950
It must also display a searchbar in the upper right hand      

56
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:16,670
corner, hamburger button,back button, title of the page.      

57
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:18,080
Very good.Okay, so let's go ahead.      

58
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:23,860
That's gonna be the big step sofar.      

59
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,960
Again, let's get rid of that.      

60
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:30,280
We gonna get rid of this and I'mgonna do like I did previously      

61
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:32,810
when I created two rows,the first one would be auto,      

62
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:34,600
the second would be star.      

63
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,821
So let's createGrid.RowDefinitions, and we'll      

64
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:43,770
create the first RowDefinition,and copy and paste it.      

65
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:44,980
And we're gonna set the width,or      

66
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,220
sorry, the height ofthe first one to Auto, and      

67
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:51,471
then the height ofthe second one to *.      

68
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:54,141
All right, very cool.      

69
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:59,959
Now, in that top one, I'm gonnacreate a relative panel because      

70
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,890
we're gonna align some thingsto the left and to the right, so      

71
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:06,040
create a relative panel.      

72
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:10,088
And inside of that relativepanel we're gonna put a button      

73
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:11,500
for the hamburger.      

74
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,250
We're gonna create a button forthe back button.      

75
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,170
We're gonna create a text box,or      

76
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:23,580
a text block rather, forthe title label at the top.      

77
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:28,130
Then we're gonna create anotherbutton that'll be aligned      

78
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:31,370
to the right-hand side, that'llhave the search icon in it.      

79
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,890
And then a text box that      

80
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:37,500
will be where they cantype in their search text.      

81
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,141
Okay, great.      

82
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:39,639
So let's name some of these.      

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,110
Name="HamburgerButton".      

84
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:49,400
This one will bethe "BackButton".      

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,210
The TextBlock will bethe "TitleTextBlock".      

86
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,370
This Button will bethe SearchButton.      

87
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:04,155
So Button Name="SearchButton".      

88
00:05:04,156 --> 00:05:09,069
And then this finalTextBox will be      

89
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,987
the "SearchTextBox", great.      

90
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:18,635
All right, so next up,let us put, the hamburger      

91
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:23,184
button will be alwaysaligned to the left panel.      

92
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:31,156
So let's goRelativePanel.AlignLeftWithPane-      

93
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:32,956
l="True".      

94
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:33,966
Great.      

95
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,303
Here, let me actually put someof these on separate lines.      

96
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,447
It'll be easier to see them.      

97
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,760
So that's the firstthing we need to do.      

98
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:47,489
And then I'm gonna go ahead andset up the FontFamily.      

99
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,237
We know that this is gonnause that hamburger icon, so      

100
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:55,530
we're gonna goSegoe MDL2 Assets.      

101
00:05:55,531 --> 00:06:02,440
We'll set the FontSize="36".      

102
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:05,970
And next the Contentis the biggie.      

103
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:14,050
And we're gonna set thatequal to "&#xE700;", right?      

104
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:16,879
And finally,I'm gonna do a Click event here,      

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,661
and I know I'm gonna need it.      

106
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:19,638
So I'll just go ahead and      

107
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,226
add that hamburgerbutton click event.      

108
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:21,895
Great.      

109
00:06:21,896 --> 00:06:24,025
Okay, next up we're gonnalook at the back button.      

110
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:30,296
Let's set its RelativePanel      

111
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:36,920
to right of the HamburgerButton.      

112
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,420
Okay.      

113
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,080
And we're gonna need to changeits font family also to      

114
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:52,280
the "Segoe MDl2 Assets" andthe icon I use.      

115
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:56,021
Let's set the FontSize="36".      

116
00:06:56,022 --> 00:07:01,659
The one that I used,      

117
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:10,952
="#exE0C4;" all right.      

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,227
There's also some coloring,      

119
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,793
I might add to thisa little bit later.      

120
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,439
But let's add the clickevent to this as well.      

121
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:26,650
Okay, next up,that TitleTextBlock,      

122
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:34,765
and we're gonna make that RelativePanel.RightOf="BackBut-      

123
00:07:34,766 --> 00:07:35,412
ton".      

124
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:40,780
And then we're gonnaset it's FontSize="28".      

125
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:44,570
And I know this wasn't veryobvious, but I actually      

126
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:48,710
set the font weight equal tobold which gave it a little      

127
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:52,070
bit of heft to it so that itstood out a little bit more.      

128
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,250
I think we're gonna have to addsome margining here as well, but      

129
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:55,740
we'll come back to that.      

130
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,540
Next the search buttonto the right most.      

131
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,262
So we're gonna go      

132
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:08,347
RelativePanel.AlignRightWith      

133
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:09,115
=.      

134
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:10,195
Whoops.      

135
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:16,640
AlignRightWithPanel="true".      

136
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:25,048
Sorry. AlignRightWithPanel="true",      

137
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:26,300
right?      

138
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:33,160
And we know thatwe're gonna need      

139
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:42,228
the FontFamily="SegoeMDL2 Assets".      

140
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,601
And we're gonna setthe FontSize="36".      

141
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:52,641
And were going toset the Content.      

142
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:56,722
And I found the Contentthat we need,      

143
00:08:56,723 --> 00:09:04,500
it is at "&#xE1A3" that shouldgive us that little search icon.      

144
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,860
Oh, and I forgot, you gotta havethat semicolon on the end or      

145
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:11,130
you're gonna get all thatblue squirly underneath it.      

146
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,940
Make sure I did everythingright here so far.      

147
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:16,485
Segoe MDL2 Assets, 36.      

148
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,390
Yeah, that looks good so far.      

149
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,690
And, we don't really need to puta click event on this because      

150
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:21,780
we're not going todo anything with it.      

151
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:24,040
So, I'll just leaveit the way it is.      

152
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,330
And, finally I'm going toadd a search text box, and      

153
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:31,050
we're going to put thaton the relative panel.      

154
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:36,090
We're gonna set it tothe left of the SearchButton.      

155
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:39,470
All right, so hopefully you cankinda picture this in your mind.      

156
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:45,470
And we'll set its Height="48".      

157
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,113
And this isn't something thatwe talked about, either, but by      

158
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:52,754
setting the Height, you're gonnaget the larger area for these      

159
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:56,411
are to type in and it'll lookjust more aesthetically correct.      

160
00:09:56,412 --> 00:10:00,650
I'm also gonna set the width toget it to look correct as well.      

161
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:03,297
And then I'll setthe FontSize="24", so      

162
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:04,629
that when they type in.      

163
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,374
The font.      

164
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,577
Something into that text box,it'll be rather large.      

165
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:09,475
And then finally,      

166
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,020
did you figure out how todo the placeholder text?      

167
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:13,540
That's kinda easy, honestly.      

168
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,420
All you do is go toPlaceHolderText= and      

169
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,820
you just type in "Search", andthat'll take care of it for you.      

170
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,250
Great.      

171
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:20,877
All right.      

172
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:23,048
So, that should takecare of all the buttons.      

173
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:33,048
Let's take a look atwhat we have so far. Okay.      

174
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:37,193
Everything's pretty large but      

175
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:39,042
it basically works.      

176
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,981
Let me make it smaller here.      

177
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,184
Okay.      

178
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:48,335
So, we've got everythingthere lined up correctly.      

179
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:50,332
You don't see the text block butit is there.      

180
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,714
Okay, great.      

181
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:56,335
So next up,let's handle the SplitView.      

182
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:59,154
So, that's gonna go rightnext to the RelativePanel.      

183
00:10:59,155 --> 00:11:02,673
Actually gonna go belowit in the row equals one.      

184
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:10,613
So, a SplitView Grid.Row="1".      

185
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:15,530
And then inside ofthat SplitView we're      

186
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:20,591
gonna need to createa SplitView.Pane,      

187
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:24,649
and then a SplitView.Content.      

188
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,153
Yeah, SplitView.Content.      

189
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,453
All right.The content one's easy.      

190
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,317
Let's just go ahead anddo that right now.      

191
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:32,996
Frame.      

192
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:36,049
And I'm gonna give the framea name called MyFrame.      

193
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,952
So, we can referenceit programmatically.      

194
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:41,911
And we'll just do that.      

195
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:45,296
In fact, I don't even need tocreate that extra space there,      

196
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:46,671
let's just rid of that.      

197
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:50,881
Pane is where we're gonna domost of our work here, and so      

198
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:53,001
we're gonna add a ListBox.      

199
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:54,633
So, let's add a list box and      

200
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,878
we're gonna adda bunch of list items.      

201
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,794
Actually just two ListBoxItem.      

202
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:02,657
So, ListBoxItem.      

203
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:06,986
And now, let's set      

204
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:11,573
the SelectionMode.      

205
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:13,149
I think this is the default,      

206
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,390
I'm just gonna setit to single anyway.      

207
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:20,465
And so, we're good there forthe moment.      

208
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:23,464
I'm actually gonna createa closing ListBoxItem tag,      

209
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:26,409
because inside of this,I'm gonna add a StackPanel.      

210
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,600
I'm gonna set the orientation ofthat StackPanel to Horizontal.      

211
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:35,047
Because again, we want the iconand then the text next to it.      

212
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:37,844
And so, we're gonna needthat to go horizontally.      

213
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,332
All right.So, let's go ahead and      

214
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,345
just put two TextBlocksin that stack panel.      

215
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:48,800
In fact, we'll kind of don't,let's just copy all this and      

216
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,580
reuse it.      

217
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,553
Like that.      

218
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:52,680
So, now we have two.      

219
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:54,712
Great.      

220
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:58,198
All right.So, the first one we're gonna      

221
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,313
set the FontFamily= to"Sugow MDL2 Assets".      

222
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:08,885
And we'll set the FontSize="36",just like we've been doing.      

223
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:12,402
And we can choose anyicon that we want, but      

224
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:16,509
I'm gonna use this particularone that I actually      

225
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,370
demonstrated inthe assignment video.      

226
00:13:20,371 --> 00:13:22,560
So, I believe this is the house.      

227
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,050
Use any one you want, though.      

228
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:28,188
So this is &, or      

229
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:32,920
ampersand, #x,      

230
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:37,958
and then E80F;.      

231
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,561
[COUGH]      

232
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:54,830
So, that shouldtake care of that.      

233
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:56,590
Let's go on tothe second TextBlock.      

234
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:01,231
And here, we'll just setthe text equal to, well,      

235
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,032
we can just do this.      

236
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:09,395
We'll just set inhere Financial.      

237
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:12,437
And we'll set the FontFamily forthis one equal to 24.      

238
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:15,836
That should make itabout the right size.      

239
00:14:15,837 --> 00:14:19,826
All right.So, let's just actually copy      

240
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:23,640
this again anduse it here again.      

241
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:28,355
And this time though,I'm gonna change up the icon.      

242
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,595
And for that little star,I'm gonna do the E1CE,      

243
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:40,460
that should work there andwe'll call this one Food.      

244
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,690
Again, use whichever iconthat you wanna use for      

245
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:47,720
that to go in MDL2 Assets font.      

246
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,985
I'm also gonna give each ofthese ListBoxItems a name.      

247
00:14:53,986 --> 00:15:00,069
So I'm gonna call thisName = Financial, and      

248
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:06,471
I'm gonna call this Name= what is this, Food.      

249
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,374
And you'll see how that comesto play here in just a moment.      

250
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:14,259
We're also gonna needto set in this ListBox      

251
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,810
the SelectionChanged event,so we'll set that up.      

252
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,761
Probably should've given thata name, but okay, it'll work.      

253
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,265
I hate when I make that mistake.      

254
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:37,365
All right.      

255
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:40,815
And before we go and actuallycheck this thing out, and      

256
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,041
run it, I'm gonna go tothe HamburgerButton, and      

257
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:48,670
I'm gonna put my mouse cursorinside that event handler name.      

258
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:52,600
Hit F12 on my keyboard, soI can get to that event handler.      

259
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:59,826
And what I wanna do is, so,my, what do we call that?      

260
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,125
I don't think we give it a name.      

261
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,380
Did we?      

262
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:04,922
We should have callit MySplitView.      

263
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:05,618
Yeah.      

264
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:09,132
It's called my split, so      

265
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:14,732
Name="MySplitView", sohere we go.      

266
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:21,004
MySplitView.IsPaneopen =      

267
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:28,040
!MySplitView.IsPaneOpen; So,      

268
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,462
that at least shouldopen it up and close it.      

269
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,924
Furthermore, I think we'regonna need to set a couple more      

270
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,102
things, now that I thinkabout it on the SplitView.      

271
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:39,944
I mean, we didn't give itsome important stuff like      

272
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:45,349
DisplayMode, and we're gonnause the CompactOverlay.      

273
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:52,234
And then also, we're gonna usethe OpenPaneLength set to 200,      

274
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:56,689
like we did when we worked onthis in one of the previous      

275
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,853
lessons when we actually createdthe poor man's hamburger.      

276
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,337
And then also, we're gonna setthe CompactPageLength="56",      

277
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:07,709
because that seemed tobe a pretty good number.      

278
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,313
Now, we can look andsee what we got.      

279
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:16,098
Okay.      

280
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,430
I see that these needto be larger fonts.      

281
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:22,333
So, let's go and fix that.      

282
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:25,079
And I also need somemargins as well.      

283
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,305
So look, we had FontFamily="24".      

284
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:33,381
Oh, duh,I'm a silly [LAUGH].      

285
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:35,430
FontSize not FontFamily.      

286
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,680
There we go.      

287
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:39,180
Fixed it.      

288
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,319
Make sense now. Okay.      

289
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:41,635
So,      

290
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:44,250
let's set the marginon both of these.      

291
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:46,695
Let's put a little space onthe left-hand side there.      

292
00:17:46,696 --> 00:17:54,450
There, like so, And I'll copyand paste that to the other one.      

293
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,847
So, the Margin=20,0,0,0.      

294
00:17:57,848 --> 00:18:00,656
That should fix that problem.      

295
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:06,248
And I also noticed that there isnot a lot of room between, and      

296
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:11,951
I guess I'd never even set thatTextBlock equal to anything,      

297
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:12,622
here.      

298
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:17,277
I'm just gonna runthis real quick.      

299
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:17,962
Okay.      

300
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,505
At least that looks good.      

301
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:20,719
All right.So now,      

302
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,939
let's get into some ofthe internal parts.      

303
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,492
I think we got prettymuch everything there.      

304
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:32,253
You must create two navigationoptions, I guess we did that.      

305
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:34,656
In the main center area,you'll use a frame.      

306
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:35,972
When the application starts,      

307
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,615
you want to load theFinancial.Xaml onto that page. Okay.      

308
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:39,190
Great.      

309
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:43,290
So right here, I'm just gonnago in the constructor for      

310
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,270
the MainPage.      

311
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:48,728
Let's go My.Frame.Navigate to      

312
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:55,276
the (typeof(Financial));That should work.      

313
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:57,520
I've got a weird littlesituation going on with my      

314
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:59,290
IntelliSense andwith this template.      

315
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,011
So, you'll have to excuse mehere as I try to get this to      

316
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:06,024
work right.      

317
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:19,830
All right.That's a little better.      

318
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:20,813
All right.So,      

319
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:26,238
least that should takecare of that situation.      

320
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:34,737
Let's see if weresolve number five. Okay.      

321
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:35,282
Yeah, it did.      

322
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,499
It loaded it up when we start.      

323
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,438
Okay, great.      

324
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,153
I realize I didn'thave this off,      

325
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:42,816
I had it off tothe left hand side.      

326
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:46,572
Number six, clickingthe navigation will take you to      

327
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:50,084
either to a page Food.xaml orFinancial.xaml.      

328
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:51,411
Okay, that's easy enough.      

329
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:57,810
So, here whenever the selectionchanged, let's go ahead and      

330
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:02,773
put our mouse cursor inthat event handler name.      

331
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:05,744
And then F12 andthat'll bring us here.      

332
00:20:05,745 --> 00:20:08,379
And so, we'll do something like.      

333
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,753
If financial.is selected then      

334
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:18,335
we'll do something else.      

335
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:22,590
We'll do something else andI can do else ifs here.      

336
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:25,100
In fact let me go ahead anddo that just else if so      

337
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:29,550
that it shows how you couldhandle multiple is selected.      

338
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,721
All right hopefullythat makes sense.      

339
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:40,418
And so when somebodyselects the financial one,      

340
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:45,356
I wanna set,first MyFrame.Navigate and      

341
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:51,954
then we're gonna send themto Type, Type of financial.      

342
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:56,919
And then I'm also gonna setthe TitleTextbook.Text equal      

343
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,892
financial, something we reallydidn't talk about much.      

344
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,265
Furthermore, whenthe app first loads up,      

345
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:06,198
I'm gonna need toset that as well.      

346
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:10,749
Like so.      

347
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:14,754
And let's do the samething down here,      

348
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:22,068
With this one andwe'll set this one to food.      

349
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:24,066
And we'll set this to food.      

350
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:24,566
Okay.      

351
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:28,998
Great.      

352
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:36,556
Okay, let's go ahead and run theapp to see what we have so far.      

353
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:42,709
All right, sowe're able to navigate.      

354
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,679
All right, we need a littlespace here between this,      

355
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,620
between this title textblock and that arrow.      

356
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:54,140
So let's go back intothe MainPage.xaml and      

357
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:56,630
go up to our text block here.      

358
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,780
TitleTextBlock.      

359
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:03,110
And I wanna set somemargin in there.      

360
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,660
So let's go Margin Equals.      

361
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:08,027
We'll put some spaceon the left of it.      

362
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:11,154
I'm gonna put a littlespace above it, and so      

363
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:14,240
our margin equals 20, 5, 0, 0. Great.      

364
00:22:14,241 --> 00:22:17,365
Let's see that how that looks      

365
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:22,748
now, whoops, I put it inthe wrong spot didn't I?      

366
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:31,443
Yep, doesn't belong there.      

367
00:22:31,444 --> 00:22:32,406
It belongs here.      

368
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:35,762
And now that should work.      

369
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:43,981
All right great, moving on.      

370
00:22:43,982 --> 00:22:46,883
So let's see whatelse we got here.      

371
00:22:46,884 --> 00:22:48,830
Here are the instructions.      

372
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:53,200
All right, sowe finished up number five.      

373
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,090
Number six, clickingthe navigation will take      

374
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:57,770
you to either food or financial.      

375
00:22:57,771 --> 00:22:58,930
We already did that.      

376
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:01,130
The background should onlybe displayed when you're not      

377
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,010
viewing the home page.      

378
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:07,880
And I guess I probablyshould say that it should      

379
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:08,530
take you home to.      

380
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:11,500
I forgot to say that butit should.      

381
00:23:11,501 --> 00:23:16,909
So, let's go ahead andmanage that state.      

382
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:23,559
So we'll gothe BackButton.Visibility      

383
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,879
equal Visibility.Collapsed,      

384
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,822
when you're on the home page.      

385
00:23:33,823 --> 00:23:36,168
But we'll have it, let's see      

386
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:43,940
Visible when you goto the food page.      

387
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,030
Furthermore, we're gonnaneed to make sure that it's      

388
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,420
set to collapsed.      

389
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,406
When the applicationfirst loads.      

390
00:23:58,329 --> 00:23:59,583
All right.      

391
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:05,519
All right, so you can seethat it's not there, but      

392
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,070
when I go to food it's there.      

393
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,902
When I go back tofinancial it's gone, great.      

394
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,850
Okay.      

395
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:18,420
And so now, whenever hit theback button, we need to go to      

396
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:22,140
financial or actually let's justdo it the right way, right.      

397
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:30,822
So, if MyFrame.CanGoBack then.      

398
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:44,010
MyFrame.GoBack.      

399
00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:48,982
And one thing I didn'tdemonstrate there is that we're      

400
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:54,168
gonna wanna make sure thatFinancial.IsSelected equals      

401
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:59,983
true, so that, even if we're notclicking on the ListBox item,      

402
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:04,660
it will still show it asthe current selected page.      

403
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:07,010
And I probably should do that      

404
00:25:07,011 --> 00:25:10,320
as we're first openingup the application, too.      

405
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,300
Hopefully that makes sense.      

406
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:13,140
So I'll show you what I mean.      

407
00:25:13,141 --> 00:25:17,660
When we first launchthe application, that should be      

408
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,540
selected, however I don't thinkit's loaded up quite yet.      

409
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,310
Let's go to food.      

410
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,700
Now you can seefood's selected and      

411
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:26,310
then we're gonna usethe back arrow and      

412
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:29,650
it sets the selectionback to food.      

413
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:31,715
So let's do that again.      

414
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:33,317
There we go.      

415
00:25:33,318 --> 00:25:36,359
Nice.      

416
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,520
All right, now we've done that.      

417
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,170
Search button must bealigned to the right.      

418
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:46,360
Okay, we got all that done.      

419
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:47,880
Back button must usea back arrow icon.      

420
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,390
Font sizes are good.      

421
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:51,570
Colors include light gray.      

422
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:55,580
Mm-hm, I think we're prettymuch done with this.      

423
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:56,890
Let's run and see.      

424
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,800
All right, sowe look good there, that works.      

425
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:03,930
We can go there.      

426
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:06,800
We can go there.      

427
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:07,750
We can go there.      

428
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:11,280
Yeah, all right,I think that's the solution.      

429
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,590
Did you come up withwhat I came up with?      

430
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:14,540
Does it work?      

431
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,400
Does it look kindalike what I've got?      

432
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,670
Hope so, andif you did it congratulations.      

433
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,400
That's awesome.      

434
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:22,850
We're well on ourway now to creating      

435
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:26,090
really good looking appsthat belong in Windows 10.      

436
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:28,410
Font sizes might need tochange up a little bit, but      

437
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:29,650
hopefully you get the idea.      

438
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:30,450
Okay.      

439
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:33,012
So let's continue on andkeep learning.      

440
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:35,540
We're gonna talkabout what happens      

441
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,480
whenever we're working on aphone device versus on an Xbox.      

442
00:26:40,481 --> 00:26:45,720
And that's gonna be kinda inthe next section of lessons and      

443
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:46,854
we'll talk about that next.      

444
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,105
We'll see you there, thanks.
