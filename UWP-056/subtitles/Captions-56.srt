1
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,010
<v ->Alright, so this is the last step.</v>

2
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:11,630
I'm going to submit my app to the Store.

3
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,710
Let's go ahead and get started here.

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,709
I'm going to begin by navigating to dev.windows.com.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,250
As you can see, I'm at the en-us, which means

6
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,490
I'm in the English, United States version.

7
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:25,030
If you're watching this from a different country,

8
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:26,951
you may see a slightly different URL.

9
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:28,670
Just navigate to dev.windows.com and it will

10
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:31,590
direct you to the right spot.

11
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:34,190
Okay, so what I want to do is click on this link

12
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:35,270
that says "Submit your app".

13
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:39,810
Now, these sorts of things are likely to change frequently,

14
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:43,350
so just look for a link on this page to submit your app.

15
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,990
It may not be right here where I'm pointing right now,

16
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:50,990
but just look on the page if it doesn't stand out readily,

17
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:54,310
because again, they change the layout

18
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:56,350
and the wording on this page frequently.

19
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:59,040
So, let's go ahead and click "Submit your app".

20
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,890
In this case, I have an old account,

21
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:06,411
so I have to accept the new license agreement

22
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:08,119
to use the new dashboard.

23
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:13,070
Alright, now I have already registered

24
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:16,970
my company to submit apps.

25
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:17,970
You may have to go through additional

26
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,210
steps to actually do that.

27
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,810
You can see that here's a previous version

28
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:24,880
of the SoundBoard that I created several years ago.

29
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:30,100
Now, let's go ahead and create a new app.

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,620
It wants me to login with my Microsoft account.

31
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:41,170
I'm going to call this "UWP SoundBoard"

32
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,300
and hope that nobody's already picked it.

33
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:48,870
Okay, so looks like we're good to go there.

34
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:51,940
I'm going to start my submission process.

35
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:58,630
Alright, so let's take a look here.

36
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:01,570
Now I have my visibility turned up,

37
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,370
so it was a little bit larger than the recording area,

38
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:06,960
hopefully you can still read the text here.

39
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,910
So the first thing, it's going to walk you

40
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:13,590
through a series of steps, and it'll show you

41
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,110
your progress through those steps.

42
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,460
Let's go ahead and begin with pricing and availability.

43
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:26,090
Alright, so I'm going to pick a free price, base price,

44
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,490
and no free trial, it's not really necessary.

45
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:31,510
You could choose a different price,

46
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:34,740
and then also choose a free trial.

47
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:39,420
Never expires up to 30 days trial.

48
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:44,030
I'm not going to add a custom price for a given market.

49
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,070
It'll be free to everybody, no matter

50
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,940
which market you live in throughout the entire world.

51
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:52,680
There's also no need for sale pricing in my case.

52
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:57,700
However, we could set a limited time sale price for our app.

53
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:01,190
We could change the visibility for the

54
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:03,170
distribution of our app.

55
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:06,090
This might be useful if we're only distributing it

56
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:10,168
to a small clientele that we want to

57
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,388
be able to access the app from the Store,

58
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,125
but not just anybody, only our customers

59
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:16,855
or people that we already know.

60
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:21,765
We could also change, and let me show those options,

61
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:25,745
change the device families on which our app can run.

62
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:27,305
Currently, we're going to go ahead and let it run

63
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:29,014
on desktop and mobile.

64
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:31,164
I'm also going to let Microsoft decide whether to

65
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:34,045
make it available for future device families,

66
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,155
rather than requiring permission.

67
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:41,085
Not going to create organizational licensing,

68
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,985
so we're not going to sell to large corporations

69
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:48,134
and then allow them to distribute to their users.

70
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:50,965
And I'm going to allow

71
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:55,375
the publish date to be as soon as it passes certification.

72
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,135
Let's go ahead and save.

73
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,465
Alright, great. So, you can see that price

74
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,025
and availability has been completed.

75
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:05,425
Let's go ahead and move on to the app properties.

76
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:08,715
I'm going to choose entertainment.

77
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:12,705
I'm also going to say this store age is 3+.

78
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:16,825
Now, there are these other age ratings

79
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:19,865
that we can supply as well, the problem is,

80
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:21,365
whenever you select it, it requires

81
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,265
some sort of certificate.

82
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,465
Honestly, this is something I know nothing about.

83
00:04:24,466 --> 00:04:26,665
So, I'm just going to leave all of these

84
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,925
to their default setting, and if we can't publish

85
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:32,935
to those markets, that's just fine with me.

86
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,444
We get to choose the hardware preferences.

87
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,285
We don't really have any hardware preferences for this app,

88
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:47,285
and we have to choose some app declarations

89
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,305
that apply to us.

90
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,885
So, this app allows users to make purchases,

91
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:55,025
but does not use the Windows Store commerce system.

92
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:56,725
Nope, that's not true.

93
00:04:56,726 --> 00:05:00,827
This app has been tested to meet accessibility guidelines.

94
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:02,559
Let's go ahead and just say it has.

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,979
(laughs)

96
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,399
I have not, and we can probably, let's see

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,989
if we can learn more about that.

98
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,259
I imagine this is for users with visibility issues,

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,139
and we've not tested it, but I'm

100
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,229
going to go ahead and say, assume that we have.

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,799
Customers can install this app to

102
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
removable media, such as SD cards.

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,639
Now, if you're really concerned about your app being

104
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:35,899
installed to an SD card and then put onto additional

105
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,579
devices, you might want to de-select that.

106
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,119
I really don't care.

107
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,079
And Windows can include this app's data

108
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,339
in automatic backups to OneDrive, sure.

109
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,850
We don't really need that feature, but okay.

110
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,789
Moving on to packages.

111
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,879
Alright, it says, if you're using Visual Studio, be sure

112
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,219
you're signed in with the same Microsoft account associated

113
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,359
with your developer account as some parts of the package

114
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,780
are specific to this account.

115
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:05,459
Drag your packages here: the .xap, the .appx, the .appxbundle,

116
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,380
.appxupload, or browse your files.

117
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:10,169
So, let's do this.

118
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:15,580
Let me just go ahead and I'm going to

119
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,970
choose a different configuration, the release configuration,

120
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,969
and I choose to build a solution,

121
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,599
and next, with my project selected in the Solution Explorer,

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,740
I'm going to go to the Project menu and select

123
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:37,740
'Store', 'Create App Packages', and this opens up

124
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,239
the 'Create App Packages' dialogue,

125
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,099
and says, "Do you want to build the package to upload

126
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,929
to the Windows Store?" Yes.

127
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,269
Here, it wants me to sign in.

128
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,139
It wants me to use an authenticator app.

129
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,079
I don't have an authenticator app at the moment.

130
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,369
So, let's just send me a text message.

131
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,069
And I'm going to block this out, so you can't see it.

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,389
And I get to select an existing App Name.

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,799
I'm going to leave all the current selections alone,

134
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,628
just the way they are, and then I'll hit create.

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,039
Alright, after a few moments,

136
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,039
I got the package creation completed.

137
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,239
Alright, so now I'm going to switch

138
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,269
back to Internet Explorer.

139
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,119
I'm going to go back to the submission process,

140
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,919
click on packages, and now I'm going to go and browse files.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,599
There will be two versions of this that

142
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,599
I'm going to submit, the first one will be for the

143
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,995
x64 Architecture, and then the

144
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,985
other will be for the ARM Architecture.

145
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,195
So, I'm just navigating through,

146
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:34,075
looking in the app packages, and you can see

147
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:39,075
that there are two files that I can select.

148
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:44,995
So, here's the one for the 64-bit Architecture, and I'm

149
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:48,824
going to add the one for the ARM Architecture as well.

150
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:00,625
Alright, looks like they are uploaded.

151
00:09:04,636 --> 00:09:08,195
Alright, so after a moment, we got the Intel Architecture

152
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:10,235
and the ARM Architecture versions of

153
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:13,965
the application uploaded.

154
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:20,405
Now we need to add some descriptions.

155
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:27,345
Here we go.

156
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:34,015
"A fun sound board application to play noises for friends."

157
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:50,197
No release notes, I can add desktop screenshots and

158
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:56,182
some of these, okay for example,

159
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,423
this app tile icon is only used for

160
00:09:58,424 --> 00:09:59,904
Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier.

161
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:01,374
I don't need that.

162
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,355
I should add some promotional artwork,

163
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,334
and then a lot of these things, I think, will be

164
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:15,374
added for me automatically, these images.

165
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:18,825
So I'm going to work my way through this list

166
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,974
of items and just start adding them here.

167
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:07,834
So, a lot of this is self-explanatory.

168
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:10,934
I'm not going to fill in most of it here.

169
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:14,044
I am going to continue on, then, to notes for certification.

170
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:16,604
I just want to let them know that they can drag and drop.

171
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:19,964
That might not be very, an obvious feature,

172
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:22,674
so I'm going to go ahead and add that.

173
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:07,264
Okay, I think that's pretty much it.

174
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:09,154
We'll go ahead and submit it.

175
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,575
And there we go.

176
00:12:17,205 --> 00:12:20,284
Okay, so that's how you submit your app to the Store,

177
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:23,225
the process that you go through.

178
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:25,345
Obviously I won't know for a couple of hours

179
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:27,804
whether it passed or not, but maybe

180
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:32,204
I'll address that in the first video

181
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:34,264
in this little section here, to

182
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:35,984
show you whether it passed or not

183
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:38,924
and what the issues were if it didn't pass.

184
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,804
So, that's all you have to do.

185
00:12:41,805 --> 00:12:43,704
See how easy it is to build an app

186
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:44,864
and submit it to the Store?

187
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:49,864
It's relatively friction-free, there wasn't a lot to it.

188
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:52,364
We could add a lot more complexity to it

189
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:54,185
with our pricing, with the markets,

190
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:57,384
with making sure that it is compliant with laws

191
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:01,064
and different marketing, text and images,

192
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:02,005
and things of that nature.

193
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,065
But it's just more of the same

194
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,884
of what we've already done, right?

195
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,364
Okay, so this is great.

196
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:09,324
Let's move on and build another app together

197
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:11,424
and we'll start that process in the next video.

198
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,354
Thanks.
