00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:07,011
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with</v>

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:09,525
www.learnvisualstudio.net,

3
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:11,324
and it's time for another challenge.

4
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:14,784
We're going to work on the Hamburger Heaven Challenge.

5
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:17,791
This will force you to create

6
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:20,926
a hamburger-style navigation for a Windows 10 application,

7
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:22,748
a fictitious application.

8
00:00:22,749 --> 00:00:23,793
Let me walk you through it,

9
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:25,674
and then we'll go through each of the requirements

10
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:27,787
just like we did in the previous challenges.

11
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,854
So as you can see here, I've got two main

12
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,257
navigation areas across the top.

13
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:34,322
To the right, you see the search area.

14
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:37,615
To the left, you see the actual hamburger button.

15
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:41,344
When I click it, it opens up the SplitView panel,

16
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:42,424
or the split panel, rather.

17
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,384
And I can select one of two

18
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:48,375
primary sections of my application.

19
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:50,574
When I go to the Financial page, you see that

20
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:53,326
that's kind of the Homepage for the application.

21
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:55,822
When I change over to the Food page,

22
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,231
notice that not only does the title change,

23
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,485
but also I get this little icon

24
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:02,916
that allows me to go back to the Financial page,

25
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,425
the Homepage.

26
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:05,824
Alright, so you might be thinking,

27
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:07,789
"How am I gonna do this center area?"

28
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,158
Don't worry, it's all an image.

29
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:12,028
I just wanted it to look finished, you know?

30
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,651
So, we'll talk about that in just a moment.

31
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:16,857
But, as you select one of these options,

32
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,422
you're going to load a,

33
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:23,521
one of two XAML Pages into the Frame,

34
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,156
just like we talked about.

35
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:27,015
This doesn't do anything inside of here.

36
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:29,853
It's just an image on that page.

37
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:32,419
There's going to be a Financial.xaml,

38
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,824
and a Food.xaml.

39
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,216
Each of them hosts a single Image control,

40
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:38,758
and I'll give you those images here.

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,218
Okay, so let's walk through all the requirements for this.

42
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,585
I'm just gonna leave this running so we can reference it.

43
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:47,884
You can see that I have quite a few resources

44
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:49,219
for you to consider.

45
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,518
Here are the Food and the Financial PNGs.

46
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,856
These are what you see in those main areas there.

47
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:58,588
Also, I have this Instructions.txt,

48
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:01,456
we're going to look at that in the rest of this video.

49
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:05,048
And then, here are some screenshots that will give you

50
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,447
some guidance on what it should look like,

51
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:09,153
so that you don't have to rerun the video,

52
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:11,823
and pause it, and all that stuff, okay?

53
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:15,319
And I'll mention that in here.

54
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,033
Alright, let me drag this into the recording area here.

55
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,757
Alright, looks like I have two number 9 instructions.

56
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:26,010
Let me fix that while I see it here, great.

57
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,786
Alright, going up to the top here,

58
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,993
you're gonna need the two images available

59
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:31,956
with the code for this lesson,

60
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:36,505
the Food.png and the Financial.png.

61
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,817
And you're gonna add them to the Assets folder

62
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,373
in your project.

63
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:43,345
Then you have to add two Pages to your app,

64
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:45,530
a Food.xaml and a Financial.xaml.

65
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,753
And each of these pages will host a single Image control

66
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,559
set to Food.png or Financial.png.

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,019
So again, this is an entire Page,

68
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,849
and it just has one Image on it.

69
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,156
We're gonna create a Frame inside of this outermost

70
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,922
MainPage.xaml, alright?

71
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:08,164
Number 3, you have to create

72
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:10,293
an app featuring the hamburger style navigation

73
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:11,866
using a SplitView.

74
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,962
It must display a Search bar in the upper right-hand corner,

75
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:15,451
a hamburger button,

76
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:18,918
button on the upper left-hand corner,

77
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,080
and a back button next to that,

78
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,285
and the title of the Page.

79
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:26,463
So this, we're talking about the Search area here.

80
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:28,856
It doesn't do anything, don't worry about that.

81
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:31,689
it has the hamburger button, and,

82
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,523
if we move to the Food, it opens up this back arrow,

83
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:38,677
and we can see the title here at the very top.

84
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,673
Great.

85
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,524
You have to create two navigation options,

86
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,786
Financial and Food.

87
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:47,910
So that's what I'm talking about here, okay?

88
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:50,091
And whenever,

89
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:52,459
each navigation option will have both,

90
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,723
an icon and text.

91
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:57,936
And the icon doesn't seem to match Financial and Food.

92
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,216
Pick any icon you want.

93
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:01,654
Try to match up a Financial and a Food icon.

94
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,850
That would be great.

95
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,127
Just go through the character map

96
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:06,786
to find something that looks like it might fit.

97
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:09,460
Number 5, in the main area, you're gonna use a Frame.

98
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,046
Okay, we already talked about that, this main area here.

99
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,956
And when the application starts,

100
00:04:14,957 --> 00:04:19,043
the Financial.xaml page will be loaded into the Frame.

101
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,418
The back arrow should be only displayed

102
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:24,087
when you're not viewing

103
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,618
the homepage, the Financial page.

104
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:28,888
So again, only should show that arrow

105
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,472
when I'm on that second page.

106
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,720
And the arrow should actually work,

107
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,315
so when I click it, we should be able to go back

108
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,119
to the Financial page, the homepage.

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,675
So the search button and the text box

110
00:04:38,676 --> 00:04:41,591
have to be aligned to the right, like you see here.

111
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:44,114
And the button has to have the search icon.

112
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:45,314
So you're gonna need to find that one

113
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,153
in order to complete the challenge.

114
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,351
Try to figure out how to set the placeholder text

115
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:50,554
in this text box as well.

116
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,354
We didn't talk about this, but there's a special property

117
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:55,139
that allows you to set that word "search" in there.

118
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,252
But as soon as they start typing, that word will go away.

119
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:01,073
Try to figure out how to set that placeholder.

120
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:04,993
Number 9, the back button must use a back arrow icon.

121
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:09,320
We already talked about that, right?

122
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:15,556
Font sizes that I used include 24, 28, and 36.

123
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:19,482
The colors that I use will include LightGrays,

124
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,957
alright, and maybe a MediumGray.

125
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,706
And you should use these images as your guide.

126
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,654
So here's the A, and the B, and the C image, right?

127
00:05:30,655 --> 00:05:33,184
And that will help you out.

128
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:34,555
And so, just like all challenges,

129
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:36,250
try to solve this without my help.

130
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:40,510
Also only watch enough of the solution video to get unstuck.

131
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,940
So, I'm going to supply the solution video,

132
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:46,284
please feel free to watch it, but struggle a little bit

133
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:49,035
before you just jump in and watch that video.

134
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:50,990
I don't want you to just

135
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,884
go right from this video into the next one,

136
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,858
and not actually try these things.

137
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,800
So, if you actually do solve it,

138
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,060
then that would be also a great chance to go

139
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,236
to the solution video and see

140
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:05,216
how I solved it versus how you would solve it, okay?

141
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:06,618
Maybe you'll learn a technique.

142
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,626
Maybe you took a different route.

143
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:10,485
That's great.

144
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:13,259
There's many different ways to solve this, I'm sure.

145
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,117
Alright, so we'll see what you come up with.

146
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:17,218
Struggle, that's how you learn.

147
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,526
And this is gonna be a valuable exercise because it

148
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:22,033
is going to be helpful throughout the remainder of the series.

149
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:24,997
Alright, so we'll see you in the solution video. Thanks.
