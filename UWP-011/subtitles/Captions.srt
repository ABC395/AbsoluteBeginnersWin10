00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,020
Hi I'm Bob Taper withwww.learnvisualstudio.net.      

2
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:12,386
So up to this point you'vebeen sitting back and      

3
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,525
watching me do allthe heavy lifting here.      

4
00:00:14,526 --> 00:00:16,472
You're all cozy and relaxed and      

5
00:00:16,473 --> 00:00:19,440
might even have your feetkicked up on your desk.      

6
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:21,871
Well, now it's yourtime to struggle and      

7
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:24,290
struggle is goodit's how you learn.      

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,790
No struggle, and no learning.      

9
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,931
So if you're already familiarwith SAMIL this might go      

10
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:29,621
smoothly.      

11
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:32,571
If you're not then this mightbe a little bit more challenging      

12
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:34,169
for you, but challenge is good.      

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,840
It might take you 30 minutes,an hour.      

14
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,235
You might have to go back and      

15
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:42,490
re-watch some videos orreference MSDN for some help.      

16
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:45,960
But I think you can do thisbased on what we've already      

17
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,670
learned so far.      

18
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,525
There's actually threechallenges in a row and      

19
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:52,245
they're all related to layout,what we've already learned.      

20
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:55,285
And so this first challenge I'mcalling the laudable layout      

21
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:58,215
challenge and you can see thatwe're building a simple app.      

22
00:00:58,216 --> 00:00:59,345
Only the user interface,      

23
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:02,217
we don't have any functionalityin this app whatsoever.      

24
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:05,707
It just has, first of allone grid and a grid only,      

25
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,777
that's part of the requirements.      

26
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:09,577
We'll talk about them ina moment and you can see that      

27
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,917
we're just capturing,in text boxes, the first name,      

28
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:15,507
last name, and the emailaddress for a sales prospect.      

29
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:16,517
And then we have a save button,and      

30
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:18,647
again it doesn't doanything at all, but      

31
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:20,853
you can kind of get an ideaof the layout here.      

32
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:25,810
As I kinda move this around, youcan see that there's one column      

33
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:29,600
here, there's a second columnthat holds the text boxes, and      

34
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:32,050
then a third column herethat just has some padding.      

35
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,200
You can also see there'sa number of rows,      

36
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:36,020
so I'm gonna let youfigure that out.      

37
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,880
Let's talk about eachof the requirements.      

38
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,880
First of all,you can only use a Grid control.      

39
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,600
Secondly, this is more of a tip,whenever I was designing      

40
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:47,578
the application, I usedthe designer of five inch phone,      

41
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,500
1920x1080 300% scale.      

42
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:54,900
The large text blockhere at the top,      

43
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,640
is 48 points, somake sure you use that.      

44
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:01,700
Most of the margins that yousee here on the left and here      

45
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:07,540
between this top text block andall the rest of the text boxes.      

46
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,170
They're either 10 pixels or      

47
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,460
20 pixels,I'll let you figure that out.      

48
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,740
And then the text blocks forthe first name, last name and      

49
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:20,580
email address should be centeredvertically in the row and      

50
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,070
I'll show you whatI mean by that.      

51
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:25,750
Presumably, this is a rowhere at the very top and      

52
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:30,720
you can see that the text box isbutted up at what appears to be      

53
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,090
the top of the row and thenthere's some spacing below it.      

54
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,220
And if you were to kind ofuse your mouse cursor and      

55
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:43,670
trace along you can see thatthe text block in the left most      

56
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:49,140
column is centered betweenthe top line of the text      

57
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:53,360
box and the start of the nexttext box in the next row.      

58
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:56,580
Okay, sofigure out how to do that.      

59
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:58,420
Now, this isthe tricky part here.      

60
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,930
Number six, you're gonna needto figure out how to allow your      

61
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,360
text block to spanmultiple columns.      

62
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,810
So when you have a need to      

63
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:14,580
tell the grid how to dosomething, what do you use?      

64
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:15,970
Use an attach property, so      

65
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,850
you should use Intellisense tofigure out the correct attach      

66
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:24,542
property to make your textblock span multiple columns.      

67
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:28,620
All right, if you ever get stuckyou can take a look at this      

68
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:33,690
extra little screen shot thatI've provide as a guidance.      

69
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:40,210
All right, and that's in a filenamed UWP-011-Screenshot.png and      

70
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,990
here's the partthat's important.      

71
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,260
First of all, you should attemptto solve this without my      

72
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:47,950
help whatsoever.      

73
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,110
Now if you get stuck,      

74
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:52,100
I don't want you to struggletoo much and get frustrated.      

75
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:55,090
Watch enough of the solutionvideo, the very next video,      

76
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:58,690
to get unstuck, and thencontinue to move forward on your      

77
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,730
own to the extentthat it's possible.      

78
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:05,290
And then, after you finish,and successfully complete      

79
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:08,340
the challenge, you willnot only feel victory, but      

80
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:12,930
you will also then want to watchthe solution video in total, so      

81
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,670
that you can compare the waythat you approached this      

82
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,020
challenge versus the waythat I approached it.      

83
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:18,760
Maybe you have a more      

84
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,770
elegant way of approachingsomething than I did.      

85
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,630
Maybe I used a differenttechnique than you did.      

86
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:24,560
So you can compare andcontrast and      

87
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:28,140
hopefully by doing that,learn a little bit more.      

88
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:30,940
And so that's pretty muchall I have to say here.      

89
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:34,460
Don't cheat, don't go on to thenext video and watch it first.      

90
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:36,410
Make sure you struggle.      

91
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,449
Half hour, an hour maybe,if it takes that.      

92
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,269
Rewatch videos if you have to,okay?      

93
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,615
So, we'll see what you comeup with in the next video,      

94
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:45,381
in the solution.      

95
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:46,101
See you there.
