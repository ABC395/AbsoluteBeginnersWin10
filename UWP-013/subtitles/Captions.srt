00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,754
<v ->Hi. I'm Bob Tabor with www.LearnVisualStudio.NET</v>

2
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,154
and I'm here with another challenge,

3
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:12,694
what I'm calling the "Legendary Layout Challenge".

4
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:15,694
And in this layout challenge, you can only use StackPanel,

5
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:17,714
so let's take a review of what we got here.

6
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:21,144
We have a large title here at the top

7
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,154
and then we have two columns.

8
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:27,874
This column is about half the size of this second column.

9
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:32,414
It has Lorem Ipsum text, which is just dummy text,

10
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:34,134
fake Latin text,

11
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,274
has no meaning.

12
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:37,174
If it does, I don't know what it means.

13
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:38,614
And then in this third column,

14
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:43,514
we have a series of squares that almost resemble a flag.

15
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:45,854
And you can only use StackPanels.

16
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:48,184
You're going to need multiple StackPanels to pull this off.

17
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:50,574
Let's take a look at the instruction file.

18
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:53,034
Let's see what I got here.

19
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:54,924
All right, again, Legendary Layout Challenge,

20
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:57,214
only use StackPanel controls.

21
00:00:57,215 --> 00:01:01,985
The designer I set to 13.3 Desktop (1280 x 720) 100% Scale.

22
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:04,055
That might help you as you're building this.

23
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,635
You're going to need a little bit more

24
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:07,435
horizontal space to work with.

25
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:10,535
This TextBlock at the very top is 48 pixels.

26
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:14,675
The left-most TextBlock will be 250 pixels wide.

27
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:17,945
And then the next one will be 500 pixels wide,

28
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:19,455
according to these instructions.

29
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:22,015
And I also want to say, yes, I know

30
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:25,465
that I said don't use absolute pixel values,

31
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:27,515
use relatives whenever you're working

32
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:30,135
with Universal Windows Platform apps.

33
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:31,555
However, this is just an exercise

34
00:01:31,556 --> 00:01:34,245
just to flex your layout muscles,

35
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:37,845
so don't use this in the real world, okay?

36
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:42,845
You should get the text for these Lorem Ipsum columns

37
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:47,845
from this file that I'm supplying called loremipsum.txt.

38
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:50,015
Just copy and paste what you need in there.

39
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:51,905
The first one, I think, only needs these two lines.

40
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:55,695
The second one that's larger, wider, needs these three lines

41
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:59,365
in order to flesh them all out, okay?

42
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:00,695
Let's go back here

43
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:04,815
and then take a look at the next instruction

44
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:08,695
which is most of the margins are either 10 or 20 pixels.

45
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:11,575
Oh wait, this third area is 300 pixels wide.

46
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:15,955
It looks like it's split 200 pixels for this large blue box

47
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:18,295
and then 100 pixels for each of these,

48
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,795
the red and the yellow boxes, okay?

49
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,815
Most of the margins that you'll see used here

50
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:26,685
between the various columns are either 10 or 20 pixels.

51
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:30,195
You're going to need to use the TextWrapping property

52
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:32,845
of the TextBlock in order to get this effect.

53
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:36,785
If you don't set the TextWrapping property equal to Wrap

54
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:39,715
then you're only going to see the first line

55
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:43,995
of the Lorem Ipsum in each of your TextBlocks

56
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:46,175
and that would not be good.

57
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:48,155
So I gave you that little freebie.

58
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,485
You can use the image that I'm supplying here,

59
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:56,485
this UWP-013-Screenshot.png

60
00:02:56,696 --> 00:02:59,555
to reference while you're building the application.

61
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:00,995
And just like I said before,

62
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:03,925
try to go through this challenge without my help,

63
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:06,295
without peeking at the solution video.

64
00:03:06,296 --> 00:03:07,745
Struggle a little bit.

65
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:08,675
Don't get frustrated.

66
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:09,535
If you get to the point

67
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:11,275
where you don't know what you need to do next

68
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:15,675
then watch just enough of the solution video to get unstuck

69
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:18,785
and then finally, if you do solve it without my help

70
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,895
or once you solve this on your own

71
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:25,875
and you're curious as to how I would solve it,

72
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,675
if I took different techniques or whatever,

73
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:30,355
then absolutely watch the entire solution video,

74
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:33,786
maybe there's something different about how I did it

75
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,096
from how you did it.

76
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:38,086
Okay, so we'll see you in the next video.

77
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:38,856
Good luck.

78
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:40,807
I know you can do this.
