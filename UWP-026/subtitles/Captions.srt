00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:09,428
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net.</v>

2
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:11,728
In this lesson we'll talk about the ScrollViewer.

3
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:14,888
I would probably say it's more of a Layout control

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,588
than it is an Input control.

5
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:18,368
But it's not even a Layout control, per se.

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:21,448
It'll just allow you to add a scrollable area

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,268
into your application.

8
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:27,548
Whether for the whole viewable area or just for sections.

9
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:30,148
We'll use it in this lesson.

10
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,488
We're just gonna add it

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,768
to specific Grids or Cells of a Grid.

12
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,288
As you can see, I have a new project called

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:38,748
ScrollViewerExample.

14
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:42,188
I'm gonna replace the open Grid tag

15
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:46,048
by adding some RowDefinitions and ColumnDefinitions

16
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:48,828
which will give us a two by two Grid.

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,148
In this first Cell

18
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,468
where the row is 0 and column is 0,

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,128
I'm gonna paste in a ScrollViewer control.

20
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,678
You can kinda see it at work here.

21
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,678
There is one little other part of a setup.

22
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,588
You can see here that I've got this Financial.png.

23
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,948
We used this in a previous example.

24
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:12,408
I just needed an image so I copied and pasted

25
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,368
it into my Assets folder.

26
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,808
Now I'm accessing it in an Image control,

27
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:20,028
setting it's Height="800"

28
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,568
and I'm setting it's Stretch="None".

29
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:25,168
This will give us something that we can scroll around

30
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,948
inside of our ScrollViewer.

31
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:28,508
A ScrollViewer is just that.

32
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,508
It's a viewable area that can be scrolled.

33
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,408
Here we're setting the Horizontal

34
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,708
and the Vertical properties.

35
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,838
The Visibility of those ScrollBars = "Auto"

36
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:40,688
which means if you need it, show it.

37
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:43,708
If you don't need it, don't show it.

38
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,548
Now let's go ahead and run the application.

39
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:49,308
You can see how easy it is to use a ScrollViewer.

40
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:54,308
(clicking)

41
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,408
This roughly takes up one quarter of the screen.

42
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,428
You can see now I have ScrollBars

43
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,328
vertically and horizontally.

44
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,428
I can move around the entire area.

45
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,148
Great.

46
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:09,268
That is the easiest case.

47
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,688
Now let's talk about some of the gotchas

48
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,088
with the ScrollViewer.

49
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,168
This took me a little while to figure out

50
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,468
so I want to point this out to you.

51
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:23,468
If you enclose a ScrollViewer with a StackPanel

52
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,888
you essentially eliminate it.

53
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,968
You can see here that I'm putting

54
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:33,488
a StackPanel in row two, the second row,

55
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,768
Grid.Row="1" and the first Column.

56
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,528
I have inside of that a ScrollViewer

57
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,240
with it's Horizontal and VerticalScrollBarVisibilities

58
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:45,540
VerticalScrollBarVisibilities both set to "Auto".

59
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,160
I have the same Image control. All that's exactly the same.

60
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,740
But notice what happens now.

61
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:55,740
Since we're inside of the context of a StackPanel,

62
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,920
you can see we have no ScrollBars whatsoever.

63
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:02,000
If I hover over the Grid cell we get something.

64
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,900
But over the bottom Grid cell

65
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:05,860
we get no way to scroll around.

66
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,860
That is the moral of the story.

67
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:11,600
The StackPanel kills a Child ScrollViewer.

68
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,660
Having said that, there's one last scenario

69
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,220
that I just wanna show you here.

70
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,060
You can put StackPanels inside

71
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:21,540
of a ScrollViewer like so.

72
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,020
In this case, I set the ScrollViewer inside

73
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:29,520
of the second Row, second Column,

74
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:31,600
and set it's Horizontal and VerticalScrollBarVisibility

75
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:34,720
VerticalScrollBarVisibility both to "Auto" if you need to use it.

76
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:38,350
Here I have two Image controls stacked.

77
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,200
You can see I'm using a StackPanel

78
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:43,460
and then adding two instances of that

79
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:46,220
Financial.png stacked on top of each other.

80
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:50,200
This time when we run the application,

81
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,860
you see that I do in fact get a ScrollBar.

82
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,940
Again, because the Parent is the ScrollBar

83
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:59,320
and the Child is the StackPanel.

84
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:02,560
In this scenario, the StackPanel is the Parent

85
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,920
and the ScrollBar is the Child,

86
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,580
so we get nothing.

87
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,120
We'll probably never use the ScrollViewer

88
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,980
quite like I did just now.

89
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:15,950
Typically, we'll use it in the entire viewable area

90
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:20,649
inside of the Chrome of the application's window

91
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,179
or the entire application itself in the case of

92
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,399
the phone form factor.

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,259
The ScrollViewer, very important,

94
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,059
we'll be using this increasingly as we work through

95
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,679
our applications because we'll need to be scrolling through

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,759
data potentially when we have lots of it.

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,479
Just like we saw in the News, in the Sports,

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,959
and the Money apps.

99
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,359
That's all I wanted to say about the ScrollViewer.

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,309
Let's continue on the next lesson. Thanks.
