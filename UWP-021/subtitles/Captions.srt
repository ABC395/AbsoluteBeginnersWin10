00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:08,469
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net.</v>      

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,710
In this lesson we gonna combine several ideas      

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,188
that we just covered in previous lessons in order to create      

4
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:18,788
what I call a "poor man's" hamburger navigation Layout.      

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,468
Now, why am I calling it a "poor man's" version?      

6
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,309
Because I'm trying to give you the simplest, cleanest,      

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,929
clearest path so that you can implement hamburger navigation      

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,789
right away in your Windows 10 apps.      

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,812
There is a "rich man's" version of this detailed at      

10
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:39,812
Jerry Nixon's blog here at the shortcut on screen.      

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,849
Like I said, Jerry Nixon works for Microsoft.      

12
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,769
He's done an awesome job with this particular article.      

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,769
Let me pull it up here.      

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,509
"Implementing an Awesome Hamburger Button      

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,309
with XAML's SplitView control."      

16
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,948
The reason why I would call it a "rich man's" version      

17
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,290
is because it's more robust.      

18
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,728
It includes a bunch more features.      

19
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,991
But it's also a bit more complex      

20
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:05,180
if you are indeed an absolute beginner.      

21
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,788
Just keep that in mind.      

22
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:08,948
You might want to visit it and bookmark it for later,      

23
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:11,428
maybe after we go through several more lessons.      

24
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:14,909
You'll be able to use his version instead of mine.      

25
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,079
What I want to do now is to recreate the hamburger layout      

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,049
that we saw in the Money app.      

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,250
When I click on the hamburger little icon at the top,      

28
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,189
the SplitView opens up.      

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,929
When I click it again,      

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,070
it closes and all we can see is the icons.      

31
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,251
Furthermore, whatever we currently select,      

32
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:34,570
you can see that one of the secondary colors,      

33
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:37,619
in this case, a darker green color,      

34
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,488
highlights the fact that we're no longer      

35
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:44,150
on the Home tab but rather we're on      

36
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,578
what I guess is the Watchlist.      

37
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,108
We're not going to implement any of these other      

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,589
pieces of the puzzle.      

39
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,108
We've already talked about many of them.      

40
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,348
I'm gonna let you do that      

41
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,509
whenever we get to our next challenge.      

42
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,699
That's one of the reasons why I wanted to      

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,449
go through this lesson is because we're gonna use      

44
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,068
the hamburger navigation Layout in several of the apps      

45
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,789
that we're gonna build together later in the series.      

46
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,149
But we're also gonna use it in an upcoming challenge,      

47
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,330
what I'm gonna call the Hamburger Heaven Challenge      

48
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,148
that'll allow you to kind of implement the full...      

49
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,989
The bar at the top of the search and the back arrows,      

50
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,029
as well as the hamburger down the side.      

51
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,669
Let's go ahead and get started.      

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,428
I've created a new project called HamburgerExample.      

53
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:28,511
You can see here, all I've done is just open the App.xaml.cs      

54
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:30,689
and I removed the Frame counter.      

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,510
Let's open up the MainPage.xaml and begin working together.      

56
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,909
I'm gonna get rid of the designer view again      

57
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,189
just because at this point it's in the way.      

58
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,649
The first thing I'm gonna do is create      

59
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,039
a couple of Row definitions.      

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,179
(typing) so create that Rows definition      

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,109
We're gonna create two row definitions this time.      

62
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,769
We're gonna set the Height="Auto" in the first one.      

63
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,769
Then we'll set the Height="*" on the second one.      

64
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:05,170
The next thing we're gonna do is create a RelativePanel.      

65
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,389
I'm gonna set that into a Grid.Row="0".      

66
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,728
I'm not gonna put that on there.      

67
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,750
Honestly, I'll just leave that off.      

68
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:20,069
Then, inside of that we're gonna put a Button.      

69
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,049
We'll come back to that in a moment,      

70
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,429
but that'll be our hamburger button.      

71
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,089
Beneath that, what I want to do is add a SplitView.      

72
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,089
Here, we're gonna add this into the Grid.Row="1",      

73
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:37,168
that second Row that takes up the * size.      

74
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:41,169
This is where we're gonna do the majority of our work.      

75
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,889
Inside of this SplitView,      

76
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,229
like we talked about in the previous lesson,      

77
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,768
I'm gonna use a ListBox control for all the reasons      

78
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,229
I talked about in that previous lesson.      

79
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,230
You'll see it all come together here in just a moment.      

80
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,689
The ListBox is gonna require us to create      

81
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,689
a number of ListBoxItems.      

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,011
I know we're gonna have several of those as well.      

83
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:02,029
I'll just copy and paste a couple here.      

84
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,668
That's our general Layout      

85
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:05,010
of what we're gonna do in this lesson.      

86
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,510
Now we just have to fill in the details.      

87
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:08,789
Hopefully, up to this point it makes sense.      

88
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,789
The ListBox will sit inside of the SplitView.      

89
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,648
Each ListBox item will have an icon on the left      

90
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:16,412
and then Text on the right.      

91
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,211
As you select an item from the ListBox,      

92
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,910
we're going to handle the Click event      

93
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:23,149
or SelectionChanged Event and...      

94
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,569
I don't know if we're going to do anything with it.      

95
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,309
I just want to show you how we would actually use that.      

96
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,569
Let's start here with the Button control.      

97
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,290
The first thing I want to do is give it a Name.      

98
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:37,691
We're gonna name it HamburgerButton.      

99
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:42,691
Then what I want to do is choose a icon that      

100
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,109
represents the hamburger.      

101
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,270
You'll recall that it has three vertical lines      

102
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:51,069
stacked above each other.      

103
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,270
To do that we're gonna find that there's      

104
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:56,428
a specific FontFamily available on Windows 10 devices      

105
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,589
called Segoe MDL2 Assets.      

106
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,249
What I'm gonna do is open the Character Map application.      

107
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,129
You can get to this by going to your Cortana search bar      

108
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,749
or in your task bar on the desktop      

109
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,609
and typing in Character Map and that should find it.      

110
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,708
What you can do is scroll all the way through all of these      

111
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:20,401
graphic assets for this specific font:      

112
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:24,481
Segoe MDL2 Assets.      

113
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:28,062
I happen to know where this one is at,      

114
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:30,021
where the hamburger icon is.      

115
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:31,441
I just have to find it again      

116
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:34,060
so bear with me one second here.      

117
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,461
Obviously, with so many to choose from      

118
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:40,243
it's easy to lose track.      

119
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:42,233
There I go.      

120
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:45,061
It's right here and you can see that the most important part      

121
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:49,222
of this is what you see down here in this little status bar.      

122
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,440
You see a capital U+E700      

123
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:54,241
and it's marked for private use.      

124
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:55,821
We don't care anything about that.      

125
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,200
The only thing that's important to us is the E700 part.      

126
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,881
Let's do this.      

127
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:05,881
Let's set the FontFamily to Segoe MDL2 Assets.      

128
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:09,160
Then we're gonna choose to set      

129
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:14,160
the Content="E700".      

130
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:18,141
I'm gonna put something before and after that E700.      

131
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:23,141
I'm gonna suffix it with a closing semicolon      

132
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:27,622
then prior to that, I'm gonna add an &,      

133
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:31,961
a #, and an X.      

134
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:35,681
Now, I'm also gonna set the FontSize large      

135
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:36,901
so we can actually see it.      

136
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:38,400
You probably wouldn't want to set it to 36      

137
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:40,520
in a real application.      

138
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:44,240
You just have to kind of test it and see what works for you.      

139
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:46,940
I think that's pretty much it.      

140
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,361
I think we're gonna add the Click EventHandler for it      

141
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:51,963
to open and close it.      

142
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:55,662
We'll get to that in just a moment.      

143
00:06:55,663 --> 00:07:00,261
Now let's take a look at what it looks like in the designer.      

144
00:07:00,262 --> 00:07:01,642
Let's blow this up a little bit      

145
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:06,461
so we can actually see what we're looking at.      

146
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,141
You can see we've got our button with an icon on it.      

147
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:09,901
Awesome.      

148
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:12,452
We can style up that button to be      

149
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,300
one of the primary colors for our apps.      

150
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,601
I'm just not gonna do that in this particular example.      

151
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,941
So we have our button and now let's move on      

152
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,140
to the SplitView itself.      

153
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,820
I'm gonna give it a Name 'cause we're gonna need      

154
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:24,941
to reference it programatically.      

155
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:29,941
A Name="MySplitView".      

156
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:34,963
Here we're going to set      

157
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:39,963
the DisplayMode="CompactOverlay".      

158
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:45,741
What I want is for it to show icons.      

159
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,921
Then when it comes out I want to overlay      

160
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:50,952
any of the content that's underneath it.      

161
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:53,981
That's why I'm choosing that DisplayMode.      

162
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:58,981
When the Pane is open, I'm going to set it's width to 200.      

163
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:04,431
When it's closed I'm gonna be around this size.      

164
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,721
I may adjust it a little bit but I'm going to set      

165
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:11,721
the CompactPanelLength="56".      

166
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:16,461
When I was getting ready for this 56 seemed right,      

167
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,001
but we can monkey with that a little bit later.      

168
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:23,081
Also, I want the HorizontalAlignment="Left" on this.      

169
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,621
There might be some other settings that we'll want      

170
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:30,522
as we test this and play around with it.      

171
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:32,343
Put all these on separate lines.      

172
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,523
Next up is the ListBox.      

173
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:38,322
This is where we're going to actually display items.      

174
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:43,322
Let's go SelectionMode="Single".      

175
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:45,991
We only want to select one at a time not multiples.      

176
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,601
That wouldn't make sense in this context.      

177
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,462
When the selection changes...      

178
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:52,843
I'm gonna give it a Name, too.      

179
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:57,843
So let's give it Name equals      

180
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:04,032
(typing)      

181
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,601
Name="IconsListBox".      

182
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:11,041
Something like that then we're gonna go ahead      

183
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:15,841
and set the SelectionChanged      

184
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:19,991
SelectionChanged equal to a new event.      

185
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,721
We'll come back to that later.      

186
00:09:22,722 --> 00:09:27,721
Then, we're gonna set for each of the TextBox items.      

187
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,701
We're gonna do something like this.      

188
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:34,061
We're gonna open it up and we're gonna need      

189
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:36,961
to add a StackPanel.      

190
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:41,961
We want what comes next to be oriented horizontally.      

191
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,161
Then I'm gonna put TextBlock.      

192
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:46,441
This first TextBlock will be the icon.      

193
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:49,502
The second TextBlock will be the actual text.      

194
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:51,482
Where will we get the icon from?      

195
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:55,791
Once again, we're gonna go to the FontFamily="Segoe MDL2 Assets"      

196
00:09:55,792 --> 00:10:00,791
FontFamily="Segoe MDL2 Assets"      

197
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:08,601
then we'll set the FontFamily="36".      

198
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:13,401
Finally, we're gonna set the Text equal to...      

199
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:17,620
Now let's find another icon we want to use with Character Map.      

200
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:20,040
We can choose any of these for this example.      

201
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,121
You'll just have to hunt through to find something      

202
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,740
that you're looking for.      

203
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:26,731
Let me choose something relatively simple like this      

204
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:31,141
little share button that we would see all over Windows 10,      

205
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:34,400
especially on the Edge browser.      

206
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:38,870
I'm gonna select that and it's E72D.      

207
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:43,640
(typing) E72D      

208
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,583
We're gonna add a ; after it.      

209
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:51,351
I'll put an &, #, x      

210
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:54,021
above it like so: "&#xE72D;"      

211
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:57,841
I just realized a mistake here.      

212
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:01,142
Font size equals 36. Great.      

213
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:04,261
The next step I want to put the text that comes next to it.      

214
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:09,261
We'll put the Text="First Option".      

215
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:13,580
Very generic, you can come up with something      

216
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:14,580
better than that.      

217
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,522
How about I just rename that to "Share".      

218
00:11:16,523 --> 00:11:19,560
Think that might be better.      

219
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:23,970
We'll set it's FontSize="36",      

220
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:31,441
and we'll see what that looks like.      

221
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,980
We may have to come back and adjust that.      

222
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:39,980
We're gonna do the same thing for the other ListBoxItems.      

223
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:45,480
In fact, we'll just create two.      

224
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:49,581
(typing)      

225
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,200
Let's open up our Character Map      

226
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:08,801
and find another icon we want to use.      

227
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,840
I'll go ahead and use this star.      

228
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,161
Anything that you find is fine.      

229
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:17,161
In this case, E734.      

230
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:24,381
E734, ; after it, &#x before it: "&#xE734;".      

231
00:12:26,602 --> 00:12:29,993
Then let's set the FontFamily.      

232
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:33,640
(typing)      

233
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:37,441
FontFamily="Segoe MDL2 Assets".      

234
00:12:37,442 --> 00:12:42,441
Finally, the FontSize="36".      

235
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,821
Then I'll just put here Text="Favorites".      

236
00:12:46,822 --> 00:12:51,821
We'll put it's FontSize="36" as well.      

237
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:57,521
I think I have enough here to work with.      

238
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:59,461
The one thing I will want to do though,      

239
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:02,941
is whenever the selection changes...      

240
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:05,801
Actually, let's back up to the hamburger.      

241
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:07,601
Whenever someone clicks the hamburger,      

242
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:09,301
remember what we want to do.      

243
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:13,780
We want to show or hide the SplitView.      

244
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:18,100
Let's go and select F12 on our keyboard.      

245
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,940
We're here in the code behind      

246
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:25,940
and what I want to do is MySplitView.IsPaneOpen = !MySplitView.IsPaneOpen;      

247
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:32,660
MySplitView.IsPaneOpen = !MySplitView.IsPaneOpen;, like so.      

248
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:37,421
Remember we talked about how that would show and hide      

249
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:41,320
the SplitView's Pane.      

250
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,423
Let's run and see what happens now.      

251
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:54,971
Alright, not exactly what we had in mind.      

252
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:59,971
I think I see the error in my ways here.      

253
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:02,782
I forgot one crucial, little thing here.      

254
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:07,782
That is, we need to go SplitView.Pane.      

255
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:13,240
Wrap that around our ListBox because it's sitting outside of      

256
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:19,131
the Pane right now.      

257
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:24,280
Great. Let's run it again.      

258
00:14:25,012 --> 00:14:28,700
I see that it mostly works. The hover works great.      

259
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,201
There's some margin issues here      

260
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:36,000
and that font is way too large but we're very close.      

261
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,200
Tell you what, let's go ahead      

262
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,861
and modify that FontSize down to 24.      

263
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,500
That should help.      

264
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:45,181
Then, I want to put some margin space      

265
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,141
to the left of this TextBox.      

266
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:48,901
We'll set Margin.      

267
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:52,381
The reason is because that second TextBlock      

268
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:55,940
is bleeding too close to the first TextBlock.      

269
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,081
We want to set some space in there.      

270
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:02,261
We'll put 20px to the left      

271
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:07,261
of both of these TextBlocks.      

272
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:12,640
Great. Now let's run one more time.      

273
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:16,563
There we go, that looks nice.      

274
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:19,240
Then the other thing we'll want to do now is      

275
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:24,171
to just create a SplitView.      

276
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:29,171
We'll set the SplitView's Content.      

277
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:37,021
For our purposes I'm just gonna put a TextBlock in there.      

278
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:39,991
I'm gonna give it a Name.      

279
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:43,822
(typing)      

280
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:47,061
Just to prove that the click actually works      

281
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:51,041
or that the SelectionChanged actually works.      

282
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:56,041
Furthermore, I'm gonna change or add to this ListBoxItem.      

283
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:57,761
I'm gonna give it a Name.      

284
00:15:57,762 --> 00:16:02,761
We're gonna call this first one the ShareListBoxItem.      

285
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:08,143
Then the second one, give it a Name="FavoritesListBoxItem"      

286
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:14,523
Name="FavoritesListBoxItem".      

287
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:20,502
Now, in the ListBox SelectionChanged EventHandler.      

288
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:24,041
What I want to do is put my mouse cursor there and hit F12.      

289
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:27,021
That'll open it up in the code behind.      

290
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:32,021
I can do something as simple as this.      

291
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:36,481
What did we name that again?      

292
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:38,202
ShareListBox      

293
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:43,202
if (ShareListBox.IsSelected),      

294
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:50,733
else if (FavoritesListBoxItem.IsSelected).      

295
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,260
Each of these cases result...      

296
00:16:57,261 --> 00:17:02,221
ResultTextBlock.Text = "Share"      

297
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:05,722
ResultTextBlock.Text = "Share"      

298
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:06,861
Then we'll do that same.      

299
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:09,920
ResultTextBlock.Text = ""      

300
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:12,083
Here's where you probably want to do      

301
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:13,871
what we talked about earlier with navigation      

302
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:18,421
and load in another Page into a Frame      

303
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,681
and that Frame would sit in the middle      

304
00:17:19,682 --> 00:17:23,121
where we currently have the content area.      

305
00:17:23,122 --> 00:17:25,231
That's something that you're actually going to need      

306
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:27,941
to do for the next challenge.      

307
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:32,743
Let's see what we have here.      

308
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:36,321
You can see that when we select      

309
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:41,321
either of the buttons it changes the selected item.      

310
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:46,061
I can even select then go away and it still selected it      

311
00:17:46,062 --> 00:17:51,061
because we have Overlay and not InLine.      

312
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,622
Hopefully, that all made sense.      

313
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,781
You're gonna need this skill.      

314
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:59,741
This "poor man's" hamburger navigation layout      

315
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:02,881
for our upcoming challenge as we move along      

316
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,301
like I said before.      

317
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:07,981
I think we're just about ready to get started with that.      

318
00:18:07,982 --> 00:18:11,141
After a quick review we'll get started with that challenge.      

319
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:13,911
We'll see you there. Thanks.
