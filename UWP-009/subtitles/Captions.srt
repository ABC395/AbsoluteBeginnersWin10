00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,949
Hi, I am Bob Tabor with www.LearnVisualStudio.NET.

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,419
In this lesson, we'll talk about

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,109
the StackPanel layout control, which allows you to arrange

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,849
your controls in a flow, by default, from top to bottom.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,419
But then we can also change an Orientation property

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,619
to flow from left to right in a horizontal fashion.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,319
We can even change the flow to go from left to right

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,119
to right to left if we want to change that property

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,479
on a given StackPanel.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,049
And a StackPanel is pretty simple.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,119
Again, it's just a panel, like a div tag almost,

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,449
if you're familiar with HTML development,

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,899
and inside of that, whatever you put

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,379
will be stacked on top of each other or side by side.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,589
And so in this case you can see

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,849
that I have a very simple application here called

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,009
SimpleStackPanel that you could load up and follow along.

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,449
Notice that I use a little plus and minus symbols

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,489
here in the left most column to roll up my code

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,849
so we can see the overall structure of this application.

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,949
And you might be wondering,

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,749
well why do we have StackPanels inside of StackPanels?

23
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,649
Why can't we just do something like this?

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,879
Well, you'll see that we get the blue squiggly line

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,049
and if I hover over the second StackPanel,

26
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,449
we get the familiar exception that the property "Content"

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,009
is set more than once.

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,519
So a Page only has a Content property.

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,119
It does not have a Children property collection.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,719
So that's why we need, I'm just going to Control + Z,

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,019
Control + Z, that's why we need an outermost StackPanel

32
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,989
and then inside of that we can put as many StackPanels

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,189
or other controls that we want to place.

34
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,649
So inside of this first StackPanel,

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,719
notice that I have three TextBlocks

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,179
that are stacked on top of each other.

37
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,179
Notice they take up the full width because we haven't

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,049
specified a width and by default,

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,689
they're arranged in a vertical fashion.

40
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,349
The item at the top will be the first item stacked,

41
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,889
the item at the bottom will be the last item stacked.

42
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,689
So it's done in order.

43
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,749
Furthermore, underneath that third TextBlock,

44
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,349
we have a second StackPanel.

45
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,309
We've set its Orientation to Horizontal.

46
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,019
So it's going to represent, I guess you could call it,

47
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,789
another "row" that's stacked beneath.

48
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,019
And then inside of that, we're stacking things

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,919
in a horizontal fashion.

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,449
So the leftmost stacked item is a TextBlock

51
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,289
that has the word "Fourth" in it,

52
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,649
the next item that is stacked next to it is a TextBox,

53
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,649
then the next item is a button

54
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,689
with the content, "Sixth", in it.

55
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,289
And you can see the effect that we get.

56
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,789
So we can almost achieve anything that we want to

57
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,219
if we're using the StackPanel wisely,

58
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,779
and as I'll say at the very end of this lesson,

59
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,149
I tend to use StackPanel

60
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,189
actually more than I use the Grid.

61
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,819
I think that it allows me to get the design that I want

62
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,049
and it gives me the flow that I want

63
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,919
regardless of the size of the device

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,589
that we're actually running on.

65
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,219
You can also see that I've got a StackPanel

66
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,149
defined beneath it with a simple rectangle.

67
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,749
And the only thing I wanted to illustrate here

68
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,489
was that we can set the height of the StackPanel,

69
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,589
and yet items inside of the StackPanel

70
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,189
can have their own height independent of the parent.

71
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,319
If we were to remove this height,

72
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,719
notice what happens?

73
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,689
Essentially, the Height of the StackPanel is set Auto.

74
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,689
If we were try to set it to star (*), it wouldn't work

75
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,219
but we can set it to a numerical pixel value

76
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,149
or we can just leave it at the default, which is Auto.

77
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,849
Let me go ahead and Control + Z on that

78
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,189
and then save this,

79
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,349
and then let us open up a more intricate example here

80
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,389
that I've created called ComplexStackPanel.

81
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,349
And as you can see, I have changed

82
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,919
from the default viewer, that would be a five-inch phone,

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
to a tablet, just to accommodate the larger width

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,989
of this design that I created.

85
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,289
And notice also, and take a few moments here

86
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,649
just to kind of line up what you see inside of here

87
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,119
with the code, because we have StackPanels

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,389
inside of StackPanels inside of StackPanels.

89
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,989
And it can get confusing, however, hopefully,

90
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,519
between the color descriptions,

91
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,219
holding your mouse cursor on it

92
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,849
and seeing the little boundary box that is selected,

93
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,949
you can kind of make heads or tails of how this works.

94
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,589
But the topmost StackPanel defines,

95
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,709
I guess you could call, a row.

96
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,589
And then also, the height of the StackPanel,

97
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,019
this topmost StackPanel, is actually dictated

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,549
by the items that are inside of it,

99
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,349
specifically this rectangle with the Fill="Bisque",

100
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,159
it's height is set to 200, so that sets the height

101
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,849
for the entire StackPanel since nothing else

102
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,419
inside of it has a larger height.

103
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,549
Also, you'll notice that I set the VerticalAlignment

104
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,089
of this topmost StackPanel,

105
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,619
and the reason I did that, because if you change that,

106
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,589
it will now get moved to the middle of this grid cell,

107
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,989
and that's just the difference in how

108
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,019
grids work and StackPanels work,

109
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,149
and we'll see an issue with this at the very end

110
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,689
of this lesson.

111
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,479
So let me just go ahead and hit Control + Z,

112
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,449
and that's where we'll bring that StackPanel

113
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,749
up to that top.

114
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,429
All right, since we're stacking horizontally here,

115
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,449
horizontally, I've added a StackPanel

116
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,519
that will be positioned right next

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,909
to the right of that bisque color rectangle,

118
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,649
and I'll arrange items now in a vertical fashion.

119
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,349
So inside of that StackPanel, you can see that

120
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,189
I create two other StackPanels

121
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,149
that are oriented horizontally.

122
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,949
So the intricacy continues

123
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,219
until I have the series of rectangles that resemble

124
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,119
something like a Frank Lloyd Wright diagram,

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,219
something that he would have been proud of.

126
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,389
Now as we continue through the series,

127
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,649
I will use multiple StackPanels to organize

128
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,349
the various XAML controls, the various XAML elements

129
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,549
on screen, and I've actually grown to the point

130
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,689
where I prefer the flexibility of the StackPanel

131
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,019
to the rigid nature of the grid.

132
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,182
And I guess that is just a personal preference,

133
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:10,299
but I find that I can usually get what I am after

134
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,049
using StackPanels and margins, all right?

135
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,289
Now one of the things that can help you out

136
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,889
whenever you are working through an intricate

137
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,019
amount of XAML and it's difficult to find your way around

138
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,119
is this little Document Outline.

139
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,189
If you do not see it by default on this leftmost side here,

140
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,919
next to the Toolbox, you can go to the window...

141
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,049
Actually, it's in the View menu.

142
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,049
And if you go to Other Windows, you can see it is here,

143
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,609
Document Outline.

144
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,249
Alright.

145
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,849
So what you can do with this is just kind of

146
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,849
make selections inside of this Document Outline,

147
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,949
and it shows you kind of the hierarchy of items.

148
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,749
We would call this a tree, a visual tree.

149
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,389
And so by selecting each of the items,

150
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,449
we get the little boundary box selection around it.

151
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,749
Furthermore, it is kind of convenient

152
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,089
whenever you want to make changes in the Properties window

153
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,819
and it's difficult to find the exact item

154
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,989
that you are looking for, just by clicking around.

155
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,949
The other thing that we can do is actually hide items

156
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,689
by clicking this left column on the right-hand side

157
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,319
to remove certain items from view.

158
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,989
And then we can also, we can also lock items,

159
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,189
which means that they can't be selected

160
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,119
and therefore they cannot easily be changed

161
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,189
in the Properties window.

162
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,079
I think you can still make changes here though,

163
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,709
if we really wanted to.

164
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,389
I haven't really tried that, but you can see that

165
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,389
it adds this IsLocked="True" to the design time experience.

166
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,889
Remember the d: prefix here that said that this is

167
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,419
ignorable at run time, but it is used by the designer.

168
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,319
Okay?

169
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,219
So that is the utility of Document Outline.

170
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,809
Sometimes, I utilize this whenever I want to

171
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,809
get at or view things isolated from everything else.

172
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,549
Okay, so this last example, I hope,

173
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,309
will illustrate a little gotcha and will help us

174
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,649
to have a better understanding of the difference

175
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,989
between grids and StackPanels,

176
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,189
and something that you need to watch out for

177
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,719
and completely understand.

178
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,619
So let me roll up this code here.

179
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,419
It is almost identical to the first example

180
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,189
that we used in this lesson.

181
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,919
This time, we have a grid that surrounds two StackPanels.

182
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,919
This first topmost StackPanel contains

183
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,679
three TextBlocks, first, second and third,

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,449
and then another embedded StackPanel.

185
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,649
Orientation, set to Horizontal, and this time

186
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,949
I just have three TextBlocks that will be aligned

187
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,419
or rather stacked horizontally,

188
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,889
so we got fourth, fifth and sixth.

189
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,789
Below that, we have another StackPanel

190
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,949
with a rectangle inside of it.

191
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,919
Now in this case, you'll look at it and say,

192
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,719
why is there so much space in between this Rectangle

193
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,749
and the bottom of this StackPanel?

194
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,619
How, what is going on here?

195
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,889
And you might think, well maybe what I could do

196
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,889
is set the VerticalAlignment here

197
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,189
equal Top.

198
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,819
And maybe that will help things out here.

199
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,889
"Wait, I lost my first StackPanel."

200
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,289
You didn't lose it, actually.

201
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,049
It is sitting behind the second StackPanel,

202
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,479
the one with the red Rectangle.

203
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,149
And so there's three things going on here at the same time,

204
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,749
and this will hopefully help you to understand

205
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,019
the difference between Grids and StackPanels.

206
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,909
So some controls like image and rectangle controls

207
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,449
that set themselves inside of a grid cell

208
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,089
will be set to 100 width and 100 height by default.

209
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,819
So that is also true of StackPanels.

210
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,019
When you put a StackPanel inside of a grid cell,

211
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,019
in this case the default grid cell, cell zero or row zero,

212
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,719
column zero, then the two StackPanels

213
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,439
are essentially, well, the first StackPanel

214
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,619
has set itself to 100 height and 100 width.

215
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,519
Now the second StackPanel has set itself to 200 height,

216
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,349
but the second thing that you need to understand

217
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,109
that by default the content in a cell of a grid

218
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,889
will be vertically and horizontally centered,

219
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,249
so we have the second StackPanel,

220
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,089
and let's remove the VerticalAlignment.

221
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,249
The default here would be center.

222
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,849
And so you can see that it is actually sitting,

223
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,089
the entire StackPanel is in the center of that cell.

224
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,089
And then the third thing you need to understand

225
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,889
about grid cells is that you can easily overlap items

226
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,149
in a grid cell.

227
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,259
So if two or more controls are set to reside

228
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,519
in the exact same grid cell,

229
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,949
and their HorizontalAlignment equals top

230
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,549
and their VerticalAlignment equals top,

231
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,649
then they will literally sit on top of each other.

232
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,019
So that is what we're looking at here.

233
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,449
We're actually looking at two StackPanels.

234
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,589
This first StackPanel takes up the entire length,

235
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,249
and the items inside of it, however,

236
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,089
are aligned to the top of that StackPanel,

237
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,389
but the StackPanel itself takes up the whole frame.

238
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,989
And then the second StackPanel is set

239
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,749
into the middle of that cell, but it's only 200 tall.

240
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,861
However, whenever we change the VerticalAlignment

241
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:24,049
and now we move that up to the very top of that single cell

242
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,619
inside the grid, that's when we overlapped.

243
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,689
So I just want you to understand that

244
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,849
about grids and about StackPanels,

245
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,849
that StackPanels will never ever allow you

246
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,589
to put two of them on top of each other

247
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,389
where you cannot see the one that is kind of underneath it.

248
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,789
Whereas grid cells will absolutely allow you to do that.

249
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,289
So there is a couple of different ways

250
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,349
that we could rectify this.

251
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,909
The easiest one is just to use StackPanels

252
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,809
as the outermost container here

253
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,949
in this particular layout.

254
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,989
However, you could also create two rows

255
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,589
instead of just one row and put this first StackPanel

256
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,849
in the top row, put the second StackPanel

257
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,209
in the bottom row, and that'll ensure

258
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,819
that they don't overlap.

259
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,319
You could also set the StackPanels,

260
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,249
you can set its VerticalAlignment to the top

261
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,989
but then use a margin to push it down.

262
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,219
That seems a little more fragile,

263
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,349
I don't know if I like that idea.

264
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,889
There's a couple of different ways

265
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,289
to still make this work even though you are working

266
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,389
with a grid.

267
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,019
But ideally, you'll probably switch to just

268
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,189
using StackPanels.

269
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,519
In fact, like I said a few months ago,

270
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,449
I typically use the StackPanel just about for everything.

271
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,049
I don't use Grids as much as I used to,

272
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,849
except to give the page an overall structure.

273
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,989
And with everything else, I try to use StackPanels.

274
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,919
And so there is this special technique, however,

275
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,889
that I learned when we talk about adaptive triggers

276
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,409
and adaptive layout that utilizes Grids

277
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,519
to adapt from a desktop to a mobile layout,

278
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,289
that wouldn't be possible with a StackPanel.

279
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,219
So it still does have its usage, I just prefer,

280
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,209
in most cases, to stick with the StackPanel, okay?

281
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,449
So that's all that I have to say about the StackPanel.

282
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,919
Hopefully, that was helpful for you to understand it

283
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,549
and how it is different from the Grid.

284
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,049
The next thing, I think, we need to do

285
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,919
is step back for just a moment and review everything

286
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,619
we've talked about up to this point.

287
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,919
Create a little cheat sheet or start that process

288
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,389
that we'll utilize throughout the rest

289
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,789
of this series of lessons,

290
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,189
and then I want to give you an assignment

291
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,519
and force you to write some code

292
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,549
and cement these ideas that we've covered up to now

293
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,009
inside your mind.

294
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,219
And I will give you the solution, we'll talk about all that

295
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,949
in just a video or two from now.

296
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,289
So let us start in the very next lesson

297
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,389
with some review.

298
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,199
See you there. Thanks.
