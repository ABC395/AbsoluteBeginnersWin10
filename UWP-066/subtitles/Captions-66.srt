1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,587
Alright, so we're making great progress.

2
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:10,807
The next thing we need to focus on is the animation

3
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:15,807
and the events surrounding the countdown

4
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:18,347
of the ProgressBar and what happens when we get

5
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:20,517
all the way to the end of countdown.

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:25,707
We need to fire off an event that we can handle

7
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:27,847
and then decide what to do.

8
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:30,507
There's really two scenarios where we need to

9
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,067
worry about countdown.

10
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:35,427
First is whenever we're cooling off, there's a cooling-off

11
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:38,067
period waiting for the next round to start,

12
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:40,367
and then there's the next round itself

13
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:44,087
that's actually ongoing and we are waiting,

14
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:47,807
we're playing the music and we're counting down to

15
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:51,567
determine the value or the score

16
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:53,507
for the player if he makes a selection

17
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:55,457
at a given moment in time.

18
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,427
So, to get the animation to work,

19
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:00,407
I'm going to have to add a Storyboard.

20
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:03,067
I'm going to add a Storyboard to the Page's resources.

21
00:01:03,068 --> 00:01:04,807
So let's get started with that.

22
00:01:04,808 --> 00:01:07,187
We didn't talk about storyboards and animations,

23
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:09,387
I only briefly described what they were.

24
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:11,987
You'll get a little bit more of an insight into

25
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,727
what they are, and Keyframes are Actions that happen

26
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:17,487
at certain moments in time during

27
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:19,377
the playback of the animation.

28
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,917
Hopefully you'll get the hang of it here as we get started.

29
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,307
Like I said, the first thing that we're going to do

30
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:30,307
is actually add a Page.Resources section to our app.

31
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:33,527
And, I'm going to create a Storyboard

32
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:37,587
and Storyboard, let's give it a name,

33
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,487
and you can see it doesn't have a name, but I'm going to

34
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:47,487
use the "x:" from this namespace here, and that will

35
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:51,087
allow me to attach a name to a Storyboard,

36
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:54,137
and I'm just going to call it the "countdown" storyboard.

37
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,307
Because we're going to need to access it progamatically

38
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,587
and that's why I want to give it name, and then

39
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,927
I'm also going to handle the completed event.

40
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:05,027
So, I'll go ahead and add a complete and

41
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:06,477
we'll come back to that later.

42
00:02:06,788 --> 00:02:09,167
Now, there's different types of animations that I can add.

43
00:02:09,168 --> 00:02:12,177
In this particular case, I want a DoubleAnimationUsingKeyframes

44
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:16,127
DoubleAnimationUsingKeyframes, and so, a double is the data type,

45
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:21,127
I want it to have values that are numeric and

46
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:26,287
using keyframes allows me to identify key moments

47
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:33,747
in the life of the animation where I change key values

48
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:40,067
of given properties, alright, so hopefully that will

49
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:43,867
make enough sense to at least get started with it, and

50
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:47,307
we're going to give a few important pieces of information.

51
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:55,027
For example, the Storyboard.TargetName, this is what we want

52
00:02:56,848 --> 00:03:00,957
to affect and I think I've called this "MyProgressBar" so

53
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,297
that's what this animation will deal with and then

54
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:09,297
the property of that Storyboard, so TargetProperty equals-- and

55
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:17,178
this we're going to just have to kind of follow this,

56
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:22,824
essentially, what I want to do is set the value...

57
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:29,128
So, typically with a ProgressBar, you have a maximum

58
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:31,228
and minimum, so I think that's pretty much what that's

59
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:36,028
denoting, just using a based class called range.

60
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:39,288
Then there's one other property I need to set,

61
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:43,158
which is called EnableDependentAnimation and

62
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,108
I'm going to set that to "true."

63
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:54,356
And now what I want to do is actually add another keyframe.

64
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:58,916
So I'm going to add a DiscreteDoubleKeyframe

65
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:01,136
and the key time will be, in this first case

66
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:06,136
at zero seconds, I want the value of my

67
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,416
ProgressBar to be 100.

68
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,606
And then I'm going to copy this like ten times.

69
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:17,346
Copy and paste.

70
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:19,042
I'll come back to that in just a moment.

71
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:22,092
And so, at 001...

72
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,852
actually let me get rid of all this...

73
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:29,207
Alright, at 001, I want the value to still be 100.

74
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:34,897
At 002, I want the value to be 90.

75
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,890
Hopefully you can see the pattern emerging.

76
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:41,690
And so now I'm just going to copy and paste a bunch of these

77
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:49,440
so at three seconds, four seconds, five seconds, eight, nine

78
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:53,827
and then at ten seconds, and we'll just keep counting

79
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:58,827
down the values, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10, OK.

80
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,587
Back here on the MainPage.xaml.cs I'm going to

81
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:16,937
create a helper method.

82
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:26,687
So, we'll start the cooldown and basically, MyProgressBar

83
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:34,376
Actually I can just call it Countdown.Begin()

84
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:41,926
Here, let's do this, whenever we load up, finish there,

85
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:45,076
we'll just call it StartCooldown()

86
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,776
Let's see how this works.

87
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:52,834
Yup, and there we go, you can see how we're

88
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,174
starting the cooldown, so we'll deliver a message,

89
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:59,694
something like "Getting ready for Round 1, Round 2, Round 3"

90
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:04,694
Now at this point we fired off, when we get to the end,

91
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:09,584
we get to the Countdown_Completed.

92
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,924
So we've got to figure out what we want to do there.

93
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:14,974
And like I've said, there's two scenarios.

94
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,394
There's one where music is actually playing and then there's

95
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:20,204
another scenario where there's no music playing.

96
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:23,234
So, I'm going to actually keep track of the current state

97
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:28,234
of the app by creating a _playingMusic boolean, and

98
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,184
I'm going to initialize this value "false" and this will

99
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,936
allow us to determine the current state of the app

100
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,446
once we hit the countdown.

101
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:46,826
So, here, if we're not playing music,

102
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:51,826
So, if not _playingMusic then what we need to do

103
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:58,666
is start playing some music and

104
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:06,096
then we'll do kind of the opposite, the StartCountdown.

105
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,566
So, the cooldown is different than the countdown.

106
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,066
The countdown will be where you're actually playing music

107
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:17,166
and we're waiting for user input

108
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:18,806
to determine what the correct song is,

109
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:22,416
so let's call this StartCountDown.

110
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:29,496
Here, we're going to set _playingMusic equal to "true"

111
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:34,496
and then I'm also going to change the...

112
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:44,186
color of the ProgressBar to red,

113
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,952
so I'm getting ready for that here.

114
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:56,202
So, MyProgressBar.Foreground equals brush.

115
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:02,132
Then in the InstructionTextBlock, I'm going to say

116
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:07,662
"GO" ... it's time to listen...

117
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:11,142
listen to music...

118
00:08:11,143 --> 00:08:14,052
and I'm also going to set the Foreground

119
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:17,342
equal to that same red color there,

120
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:20,982
and then I'm going to call countdown begin again.

121
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:27,722
So, in the cooldown we kind of want to do the exact opposite

122
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:30,712
So, I'm going to StartCooldown(), we're going to set

123
00:08:30,713 --> 00:08:33,262
_playingmusic equal to "false"

124
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:38,982
and actually, let me grab several things here

125
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,782
This will be blue instead of red.

126
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,352
And then in the InstructionTextBlock

127
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:56,352
we want to do String.Format("Get ready for round ...12800:09:00.813 --> 00:09:03.263and then I've got to figure out what round it is.

128
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,682
So, here's another place where I'm going to have to

129
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,782
keep track of which round we're in.

130
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:10,662
Let's go up here,

131
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:15,942
and let's go: int _round equals zero

132
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:20,042
Yeah, seems right, ok.

133
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,102
So, then here, we're going to go

134
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:28,540
_round plus one because that'll be the next...

135
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,460
the next round will be round one right,

136
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:35,860
and, I'm also going to do InstructionTextBlock.Foreground

137
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:39,030
equals brush, like that.

138
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,870
We're going to call StartCountdown()

139
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:50,598
And, here what I want to do is...

140
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,458
there's a bunch of things that have to happen,

141
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:57,458
like, we're going to evaluate the user's selection, and

142
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,578
score it, and all that kind of stuff, and then

143
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,508
eventually, we're also going to...

144
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,078
we're going to want to start the cooldown again.

145
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:14,964
So StartCooldown() here.

146
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,224
Alright, so let's see how this works.

147
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:28,152
OK, so we're getting ready for round 1.

148
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:36,000
Alright, and you can see here now we're playing.

149
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,390
And ideally, I would make a selection here

150
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:41,090
and it'll reset everything, but I'm going to go ahead

151
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:43,040
and let it tick all the way down.

152
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:47,368
OK, so we're just kind of waiting here, you get

153
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:50,668
minimal points at this point even if you selected it true,

154
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:54,208
but by selecting a song, it will start the next round,

155
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:57,978
we just have to increment the round number.

156
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:02,568
So that's one of the things we'll want to do here.

157
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,558
It's going to be a round like that...

158
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:13,106
Whoops, what I wanted to do was ++.

159
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,006
Can we do that?

160
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,836
Yea, great.

161
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,999
OK, so we got the countdown working,

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,079
got the Storyboard working.

163
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,279
We need to select the next song that we want played,

164
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,879
and that's really going to get kicked off

165
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,499
here when the cooldown is completed

166
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,179
and this fires and we're not playing music

167
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,179
that means we want to start playing music, so

168
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,079
here I want to pick a song, so...

169
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:46,079
let's do something like this, var song equals pickSong()

170
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,361
and we don't have that implemented just yet, so let's

171
00:11:55,392 --> 00:12:00,391
create private void pickSong

172
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:06,413
and actually it's not going to be void,

173
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:08,643
it's going to return a Song.

174
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:20,360
And what we need to do is

175
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:24,260
first of all, we're going to need to use the Random class,

176
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:32,680
and, so here's what my thought process is,

177
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:37,876
this is what I would like to do.

178
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:41,076
I would like to have a list of unused songs,

179
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:44,696
songs that we've not touched yet that are still available

180
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,006
on that list of songs we initially picked out.

181
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:49,856
So of all the songs, give me all the songs where

182
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:54,856
the "used" property is "false" so we need to add another

183
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:02,206
attribute to "song" called "used."

184
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:12,116
And, obviously by default, that would be...

185
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:17,116
that should be false, but we'll populate that.

186
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:20,936
And now what we'll want to do is grab the random number.

187
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:25,936
It goes Random.Next() give me a random number

188
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:33,396
of unusedSongs.count like that

189
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:36,238
and so then we'll get the randomSong...

190
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:43,608
equals unusedSongs.element at randomNumber

191
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:52,108
and so that randomSong now is currently the selected song

192
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:56,228
so I'm going to set it's selected attribute to "true"

193
00:13:56,229 --> 00:14:00,438
and then return that randomSong, like so.

194
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:03,438
So we pick the song,

195
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:10,508
and now I need to go "MyMediaElement.SetSource"

196
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,908
and I want to set it to my song.

197
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:24,548
Now the Song class does contain

198
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:28,496
the song file, right.

199
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:33,496
That's of type StorageFile, and in order to call this

200
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,296
SetSource() method I'm going to need to give it two things.

201
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:41,836
First of all, I'm going to need to give it the stream

202
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:46,116
from the file itself so basically I need to open up the file

203
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:51,116
and give it a pipeline into that file,

204
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:55,626
and then I need to give it the content type, the mime type.

205
00:14:55,737 --> 00:14:57,976
So that's easy enough, I can just

206
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,926
use a property called ContentType.

207
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:02,356
But, the other one, I'm going to have to do

208
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:04,886
actually something a little bit nifty here.

209
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:09,896
Song.SongFile.Open, I want you to open yourself and

210
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:13,176
I need an access mode just for read-only,

211
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:14,646
I'm not going to write to you.

212
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:18,906
Now, obviously this is async, so it's await-able,

213
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:20,846
I have to do something like that...

214
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,856
In fact, let's go ahead and knock that to the next line,

215
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,536
put that on the next line, and do that.

216
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:28,636
And so that would make this

217
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,536
async...

218
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:34,604
(Do I not even return a task to that...)

219
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:35,704
(I don't know that I do...)

220
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:39,974
(I'm not going to this time. OK)

221
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:44,844
So, MyMediaElement.SetSource, and then

222
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,264
I want to start the countdown after I've made that...

223
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:49,474
after I've made that pick.

224
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:54,414
So let's see what happens here.

225
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:57,494
We're pretty close here to a working prototype.

226
00:15:59,185 --> 00:16:01,424
OK, we grab all the song, now let's

227
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:02,724
get ready for round one.

228
00:16:02,725 --> 00:16:04,364
If we're lucky, at the end of round one,

229
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:07,844
when this goes away, when we get down to

230
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:09,374
the end of the cooldown...

231
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:11,664
Oh, and here we go

232
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:14,194
[Music playing]

233
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,348
Ok, so it mostly worked.

234
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,644
There's some things after the click I've got figure out,

235
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:24,384
like, did they click on the right song or not,

236
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:26,484
if they didn't what are we going to do then.

237
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,994
But we'll get to that.

238
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:33,324
Actually, I think we're good to go in this video.

239
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,824
We will continue on to the next one where we actually

240
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:39,504
do that evaluation of what the user clicked on

241
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:42,114
and what points do we give them as a result of that,

242
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:45,324
so we'll do that next, we're doing great.
