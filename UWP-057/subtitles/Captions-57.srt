1
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,412
<v ->Okay, so the next app that we're going to build together</v>

2
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:10,151
is a very simple weather application.

3
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:13,580
Now I realize there are stock apps that come with

4
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,970
Windows 10 on the desktop and the phone,

5
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:18,010
however, this one will allow us to express

6
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:21,149
a little individuality, a little design.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,600
Also, we'll demonstrate some pretty cool features

8
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,500
of both Windows 10 the platform

9
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:29,370
and then how to work with external services

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:32,926
to get data to update and make your apps come alive.

11
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:35,328
So I'll go ahead and run the application.

12
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:37,628
Actually let me run it just on the desktop

13
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:40,528
and just have to trust me that it works

14
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:43,298
in the mobile version as well.

15
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,608
And the name of the application I'm calling

16
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,128
UWP Weather.

17
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:50,048
It's a simple weather app.

18
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:53,618
It's just going to go out and based on my current location

19
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,248
here in Dallas, it's going to go out and find

20
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:59,888
the current weather, what the weather conditions are,

21
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,408
where I'm actually at here.

22
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:05,358
I'm in Plano, Texas and then also will display

23
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,868
an image, a cute weather image with a hot pink background

24
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:17,428
to convey what the current weather is where I'm at.

25
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:21,028
So in the process of building this, first of all,

26
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:23,408
this is a great start to a weather application

27
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,748
that you can take and extend and you're going

28
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,168
to learn how to do that.

29
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:30,948
You can add, you know, a two week forecast if you want

30
00:01:30,949 --> 00:01:35,148
using online services that I'll point you to in this series.

31
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:36,928
But one of the main things that you'll learn

32
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:40,788
is how to use sensors on your device or in actuality

33
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:44,248
the location services for Windows 10 to determine

34
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:47,408
the geo position where the device or your computer

35
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,428
is currently at So that would give the latitude

36
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:52,228
and longitude that we can then take

37
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,748
and we can make calls out to an external web service

38
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:57,518
like the openweathermap.org,

39
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,288
which will allow us to give in a place,

40
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,528
a latitude, longitude, will give us the weather

41
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:08,478
for that location and even future forecasts

42
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,108
for the hours and days ahead.

43
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:13,329
So it's going to also allow us then

44
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,448
to learn how to retrieve data from a web service

45
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:20,528
in a typical fashion through a file format

46
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,988
called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation),

47
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,428
maybe you're already familiar with that

48
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:28,588
and deserialize that into instances of classes

49
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:30,508
that we can work with in C#.

50
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,688
Very crucial skill, outside of this example

51
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,168
and throughout the rest of your life

52
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,028
as a software developer.

53
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,958
You have to know how to serialize and desterialize data

54
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,698
from data formats like XML and JSON

55
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:45,108
into objects and back.

56
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,208
And then we're going to look at how to work with

57
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,308
the Phone Emulator to test our application,

58
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:55,528
not just as it's used on the mobile device itself

59
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:58,348
and the layout, things of that nature, but then also

60
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,678
how to change the position

61
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:05,798
and kind of tell the location services

62
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,818
that we're actually coming from, Seattle or Washington, DC,

63
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,958
or China, or whatever.

64
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,268
And so we'll look at a cool feature of the emulator

65
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:19,188
to do that as well for testing.

66
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:21,378
And then we're going to take a look at how to build

67
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,068
a live tile for our application

68
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:26,928
that we'll update periodically with the latest weather

69
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:30,588
for our geo position, our latitude and longitude.

70
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:34,722
And so that will teach us not only how to build live tiles,

71
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:37,812
but then also we'll learn how to create a web service

72
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:42,292
using ASP.NET MVC 5 and host it out as your website

73
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:45,396
so we're bring together a lot of cool technologies

74
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:48,876
to build a very interactive application.

75
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:51,156
So beginning in the next video we'll get started

76
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:54,776
with the layout and learning how to access that web service

77
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:56,676
and get back the data that we need.

78
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:58,426
We'll begin that process in the next video.

79
00:03:58,427 --> 00:04:00,756
We'll see you there, thanks.
