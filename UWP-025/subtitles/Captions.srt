00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:09,594
ďťż- Hi I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net,

2
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:12,759
and in this lesson we're going to add more controls

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,274
to our repertoire.

4
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:17,559
And we'll do it exactly like we did the previous time,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,984
where we copied in some XAML, talked about the Control,

6
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:24,889
showed you how to access the values of that Control

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,029
and so on.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,524
So let's begin by getting our example started off.

9
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:30,154
You can see that I created a new project called

10
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,219
ControlsExamplePart2,

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,359
and I'm going to replace the Grid with one that I had

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,189
on my clipboard.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,794
This will create a number of RowDefinitions

14
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:43,089
and two ColumnDefinitions.

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,024
And inside of here, we're going to begin to copy and paste

16
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:50,754
some XAML for the various Controls that we'll cover.

17
00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:52,284
We're going to start by talking about Controls

18
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,744
that allow user input for times and dates.

19
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,784
And so the first Control that I want to call

20
00:00:57,785 --> 00:00:59,684
your attention to is the TimePicker.

21
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,624
This would allow a user to select an hour

22
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,584
and a minute for your application.

23
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:09,959
So say I want a reminder at 9:30 PM,

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,554
this would allow your user to easily select that

25
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,849
whether with touch or with mouse.

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,279
So the most interesting property, I believe,

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,424
is this ClockIdentifier property.

28
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:22,319
It comes with two potential values,

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,554
either a 12HourClock that will allow the user

30
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:26,684
to select AM/PM,

31
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:29,094
or a 24HourClock, which in the United States,

32
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:30,924
is known as military time.

33
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,339
So I'm going to choose the 12-hour clock,

34
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,624
and then let's go ahead and run the application.

35
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:40,139
And you can see that currently, as I'm recording,

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,789
it is 4:07 PM.

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,094
As I select the Control itself, it shows

38
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:49,529
a nice pop-up that would look good in a mobile device,

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,584
as well as a desktop.

40
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:55,754
And here I can select different times and choose AM/PM

41
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:59,429
and then click the check mark for acceptance

42
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,244
or the X to cancel.

43
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,924
All right, and you can see my selections now are displayed

44
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,919
in the Control's body as well.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,159
Very nice.

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,919
The next Control that I want to talk about relates to dates.

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,094
And there are actually two of these.

48
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:17,594
The first one is what is called a CalendarDatePicker.

49
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,709
And so when you hear the term "Picker",

50
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,154
typically you're going to see a flyout up here.

51
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:25,319
In other words, you're not going to see the entire body

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,484
of the Control, you'll just see

53
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:27,624
a little part of the Control.

54
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,589
You click on that Control and it will show you more

55
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,484
items to choose from.

56
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,229
In this case, you'll see a Calendar pop up.

57
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,784
So let's go ahead and run the application as is,

58
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:40,184
and then we'll talk about some of its special properties.

59
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:42,849
So here you can see that we get this little Control,

60
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,549
select a date, a little date or Calendar icon

61
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,094
off to the right hand side.

62
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:49,629
And when I select it, you can see that

63
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,144
we get a nice Calendar here.

64
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,319
Today is selected by default.

65
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,494
I can move up and down in months.

66
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:58,119
I can choose different dates and when I do,

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,659
notice that it makes that selection

68
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,919
and puts it into the visible area of that CalendarPicker.

69
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,159
Now if you take a look here over on the,

70
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,834
let me get this off here,

71
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,859
take a look out here on the right-hand side

72
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,994
in the Properties area, you can see that there are

73
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,339
a number of interesting Properties

74
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,814
like the type of Calendar that we're going to use.

75
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,554
By default, in the United States,

76
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:23,989
it's set to GregorianCalendar.

77
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,089
However, you can see that there are

78
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,519
many different types of Calendars for various

79
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,694
Asian countries.

80
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:34,819
There is a HebrewCalendar and others as well, okay?

81
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,924
IsTodayHighlighted, that is interesting.

82
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:39,829
It's, by default, selected.

83
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,554
You can change the PlaceholderText,

84
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,524
and I'll just go ahead and change that to "choose a date",

85
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,519
and we'll see that the next time we run.

86
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,689
And there might be some other interesting

87
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,624
little things here, but I think that is probably

88
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,549
the majority of the interesting things to look at

89
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,154
with the CalendarDatePicker.

90
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:59,289
Now the other type of Calendar Control

91
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,529
is actually just called the CalendarView.

92
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,619
And when you hear the word view, typically,

93
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,239
in XAML controls, it means that it is going to be

94
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,629
displayed all of the time.

95
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,554
So in this case, we have a CalendarView control,

96
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:16,889
you can see that I have a SelectedDatesChanged EventHandler.

97
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,184
So let me go ahead and just create that EventHandler

98
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:21,194
by putting my mouse cursor on that word

99
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:23,189
and then hitting F12 on the keyboard,

100
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,429
that should satisfy for now.

101
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,954
We'll come back to and add some code to that

102
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:27,154
in just a moment.

103
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:29,529
Notice here that we can make Multiple selections

104
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,719
in the Calendar instead of just one.

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,429
Let's see what the other values are.

106
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,744
So No selection, a Single date selection

107
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,784
or Multiple date selections.

108
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:43,004
Leave it at Multiple and then run the application.

109
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:48,849
And so you can see today is highlighted by default.

110
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,449
I can make various selections and notice that

111
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,734
everytime I make a selection it highlights that date, okay?

112
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,119
Notice how much space this actually takes up

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,339
in our application as well.

114
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:07,144
Now let's actually handle the SelectedDateChanged,

115
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:11,044
and you can see here that I've added a TextBlock called

116
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,354
CalendarViewResultTextBlock.

117
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,524
What I want to do inside of that is add

118
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:19,319
all of the SelectedDates so that we can see them.

119
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,754
Now to get to the SelectedDates, we'll go

120
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,144
into the SelectedDateChanged EventHandler,

121
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:28,289
and I'm going to copy in some code here

122
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,019
and explain what it does.

123
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,319
So you might think that

124
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,894
what I do here is a little bit roundabout,

125
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:37,819
but I'm going to explain why we do all of this.

126
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,189
Let me move this over to the side here.

127
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,494
Alright, so what I want to do is get

128
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:43,084
a list of SelectedDates.

129
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:46,749
So the sender is of type CalendarView,

130
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,929
so we're going to say give me all the SelectedDates

131
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,149
for that Calendar Control.

132
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,294
Then we're going to Select

133
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:57,424
and make sure that we're choosing

134
00:05:57,425 --> 00:06:02,424
or projecting out of those selections, the month/day.

135
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,929
The Select statement is a projection statement and link

136
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,019
and we're just choosing the data that we want to spit out

137
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,359
or emit from that statement.

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,859
So we're getting all the SelectedDates

139
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,119
but just give me the date/day as a string

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,149
and then I want all those dates to be added to an Array.

141
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,194
So I called the ToArray() in the very end of that.

142
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:27,349
So now we have an Array of strings called SelectedDates,

143
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,124
and the reason I put them in an Array is so that

144
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,744
I can call the string.Join method and separate

145
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,784
each of them with a comma.

146
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,929
And you'll see the effect in just a moment.

147
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,894
Now that we have are joined string,

148
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:41,289
we can set it as the text property to that TextBlock

149
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,159
that I added.

150
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,869
So let's see how this works.

151
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,509
All right, so now I'm going to start selecting some dates.

152
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,029
And as I select them, notice that they show up

153
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,444
as the month/day,

154
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,559
and they're separated by commas, all right?

155
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,074
So hopefully that little snippet of code will help you

156
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:03,759
to work with Multiple date selection.

157
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,784
All right, so that's enough with dates and times.

158
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,449
Let us move on and talk about the next thing,

159
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,189
which is going to be a Flyout Control.

160
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,024
And there is two different Flyout buttons

161
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,884
that we're going to look at.

162
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:17,554
The first one will just pop open

163
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,424
a little message box for us here.

164
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,449
So you can see that...

165
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,754
Actually, let me do this.

166
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:27,124
Let me put my mouse cursor in that Click,

167
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,544
that Click EventHandler,

168
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:30,059
InnerFlyoutButton_Click.

169
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,754
Hit F12 in my keyboard.

170
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:35,084
That'll create the EventHandler stub,

171
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,289
which we'll come back to in just a moment.

172
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,049
And what we'll do is you can see that

173
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,789
many of the Controls actually, in this case,

174
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,084
the Button Control, has a Flyout property.

175
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,684
And what you can put inside of that Flyout property

176
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,089
is either a Flyout or a Flyout menu

177
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,994
like we'll look at in just a moment.

178
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:54,129
And inside of that Flyout, we can add

179
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,284
any Controls that we want.

180
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,994
In this case, I'm going to create a StackPanel

181
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:58,644
and add a TextBlock and a Button.

182
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,224
And here I'm just going to put out some text inside of that

183
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:04,794
little dialog that I'm creating kind of manually.

184
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:06,819
And so then when somebody clicks the Button,

185
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,984
what we want to do is actually hide that Flyout again.

186
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:12,669
So let me go ahead and hit F12 again

187
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,294
with my mouse cursor selected on that name,

188
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,594
and I am going to add some code that will actually hide

189
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:21,219
the Flyout so that when we click the OK button,

190
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,319
that Flyout will hide.

191
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,479
Now you might be still wondering, what does this do?

192
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,989
I don't even know what a Flyout is?

193
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,749
Well, here.

194
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,989
You'll see, it's real simple.

195
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,684
Here's my little Flyout button,

196
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:32,859
it could be many different controls but in this case,

197
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,344
we're choosing a Button,

198
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,989
and when I click it you can see that there is a little

199
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,859
dialog box that I created with a little message.

200
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,049
And when I click the OK button, it hides.

201
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,829
Alright?

202
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,389
So that's one style of Flyout.

203
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,149
Let's take look at now a Flyout menu.

204
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,884
And you've probably seen these if you've worked

205
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:55,479
inside of

206
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:59,149
inside of Windows 10

207
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,919
or inside of the Windows 10 on the phone,

208
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,589
and this will often be useful

209
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,949
whenever you are trying to create a contextual menu

210
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,524
for giving control.

211
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:13,644
In this case, again, I'm only going to use a Button,

212
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:15,424
but you'll see that many different Controls

213
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:18,589
have a Flyout property, a complex property

214
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,789
that we can add this MenuFlyout.

215
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,384
We can also state where we want this placed.

216
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:27,949
Here in this case, I am saying put it to the Bottom.

217
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,119
But we can set it to the Left, the Right,

218
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,994
the Top or make it full-screen.

219
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:34,124
Let's go Bottom again.

220
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,619
So we want it below whatever, if possible,

221
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,154
put the menu below the Button.

222
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:43,024
Next up, we're going to create a series of Flyout

223
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:45,319
or MenuFlyoutItems,

224
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,219
and each of these could have a Click event

225
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,519
that we can handle, but I am not at the moment.

226
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,044
Here is a FlyoutSeparator, so a little line

227
00:09:57,045 --> 00:10:00,084
that will make sections inside of our context menu

228
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,584
that we created.

229
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:05,694
Here, we're creating a MenuFlyoutSubItem.

230
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,249
So this will allow us to create kind of a hierarchical menu.

231
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,189
So inside that Item 3, when we click it,

232
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,619
we'll see Item 4, Item 5.

233
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,954
Item 5 is another SubItem Menu Flyout,

234
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:22,459
which has Item 6 and Item 7.

235
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,159
Alright.

236
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,394
And then also, at the very bottom you'll see that

237
00:10:25,395 --> 00:10:27,879
I have a ToggleMenuFlyoutItem,

238
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,649
and this is useful whenever you want to turn something

239
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,019
on and off and show that

240
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,629
a selection has been made for a little,

241
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,984
a little checkmark in the left-hand corner.

242
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,944
Okay, so let's go ahead and run the application.

243
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,459
And unfortunately, we can't see it.

244
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,184
But I'm going to go ahead and click it now.

245
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,594
I said put it to the bottom,

246
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:53,774
however there wasn't enough space below it so in this case,

247
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:55,019
it put it above it.

248
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,419
But notice I have two items and then a separator,

249
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,729
then I have Item 3, which gives me a submenu,

250
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,314
and Item 5 which even gives me an additional submenu.

251
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:07,884
And then with Item 8, I selected it,

252
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:09,219
and now the next time I look at it,

253
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,689
it has a checkmark next to it.

254
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,619
So now it is, now it is off.

255
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,624
Okay?

256
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,114
So this is useful for contextual menus.

257
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:18,979
Again, I want to emphasize that

258
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,614
I'm using a Button in this case,

259
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:24,124
but we can use many different Controls that have this

260
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:28,024
Flyout property, where we can add

261
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:32,659
a contextual menu or just dialog as a result

262
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,699
of clicking on that item or interacting with it in some way.

263
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,614
All right, so the next item that I want to take a look at

264
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,474
is the AutoSuggestBox.

265
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,889
And this will become very helpful to us

266
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,954
whenever we're building real applications

267
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,724
that include the search feature

268
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,794
like a hamburger-style navigation that we've seen

269
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:50,824
up to this point.

270
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:52,954
Here again, so that the application compiles,

271
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:56,139
I'm going to put my mouse cursor on

272
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,359
this little TextChanged EventHandler

273
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,879
and then hit F12 in my keyboard just to create the stub

274
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,424
and my code behind.

275
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,359
And then coming back here to the MainPage,

276
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,884
you can see that I have

277
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,759
a number of interesting Properties here like

278
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,224
the PlaceholderText.

279
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:17,594
So we're going to say Search or Find Something,

280
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,019
maybe something like this,

281
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,459
so that this is very distinctive, right?

282
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,554
We can set also the QueryIcon.

283
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:28,309
Let's see what our options are there.

284
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,074
All right, so there are a number of different icons

285
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:32,619
that we can choose from.

286
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,324
But in our case, let us just go back to the Find icon.

287
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,084
Now let's run the application.

288
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:42,394
Now what it will do by itself,

289
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,394
there's not a whole lot that it'll do, honestly.

290
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:47,419
Unfortunately let's move that up a little bit.

291
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,294
So I can start typing in here,

292
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:50,719
and nothing really happens.

293
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,824
And you might think, "Well, this is not very interesting."

294
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:57,574
The reason this becomes interesting, as I close this down,

295
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,889
is what you can do with it to filter results.

296
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,184
So let's go back over here into the code behind,

297
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,504
and at the very top, what I want to do

298
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:09,304
is copy in a new Array of strings that I am calling

299
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,249
selectionItems.

300
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,379
And you can see that this is just a list of names.

301
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,314
And some of them start with the letter F,

302
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:20,029
some of them start with the letters F-R, F-R.

303
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,109
Some of them start with the letter T, T-A, T-O, okay.

304
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,124
And we're going to see how we narrow down that selection

305
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,524
as we type, as the text is changing

306
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,489
in that AutoSuggestBox.

307
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,884
Now we don't get that functionality automatically.

308
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:38,329
We're going to have to add some code.

309
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,474
And so I'm pasting in some additional code here.

310
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,919
The sender is an AutoSuggestBox,

311
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,239
so I'm just getting a reference to it

312
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,129
here in this line number 48.

313
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,089
In line number 49, here I'm going to do a Where clause

314
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,954
on that Array of strings, that selectionItems

315
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:54,694
that I paste in up here.

316
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:58,659
So we're going to filter that list

317
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,344
by looking for items that start with whatever text

318
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:04,119
was typed into the AutoSuggestBox.

319
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,339
Then we'll call ToArray on it,

320
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,844
and we'll use that filtered box and pass it

321
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,249
to the ItemsSource of our AutoSuggestBox.

322
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,754
And now that source will be,

323
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,329
you will see a little menu pop up

324
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,729
with all the filtered items that we can choose from.

325
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,739
So let's go ahead and run the application.

326
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:26,109
All right, so this time I'm going to type in the letter F.

327
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,249
And as you can see when I do that,

328
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,794
I get a number of options.

329
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:31,684
And then I can use the up and down arrow

330
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:34,054
to actually select one of the two.

331
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:38,524
So as I select it, then it removes all the other options.

332
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:41,719
All right, so let's try that with T.

333
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,519
T-A,

334
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,424
T-A-N,

335
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,059
T-A-N-Y,

336
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,874
and then I can use the down arrow

337
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,389
and then hit enter on my keyboard, it makes that selection.

338
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,559
So the AutoSuggestBox, very helpful,

339
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,194
especially for a search feature

340
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,624
that we'll be adding to our applications.

341
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,384
All right, so let's go on to the next one.

342
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:05,294
I want to talk about the Slider Control.

343
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:10,259
And the Slider, you'll see this often used in Windows 10.

344
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,054
It will allow the user to make a selection.

345
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:16,019
Here, we're going to make, allow them to make

346
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,919
a Maximum selection of 100 and a Minimum selection of 0.

347
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,244
So when we run the application,

348
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:24,854
you can see that there's this little Slider Control.

349
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:27,749
And it even has the number above it.

350
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,274
We can control the increments and whether or not

351
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,584
to display that little thing on the top.

352
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:36,659
But you'll this often used in Windows 10.

353
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,059
We're going to use it too in our applications.

354
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,289
The next thing I want to show,

355
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,824
that kind of goes along with it, is...

356
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,599
I'm going to copy some of it but not all just yet,

357
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:53,624
I'm going to talk about a ProgressBar.

358
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,659
And a ProgressBar will give feedback to the user

359
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,759
for long-running operations.

360
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,199
So in this particular case,

361
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,724
I can set the Value="57".

362
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,524
So the Maximum will be 100,

363
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:09,609
but I'm going to hardcode this Value to 57.

364
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,679
So let's run the application,

365
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:19,384
and you can see that we're 57% of the way through

366
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:20,719
our progress.

367
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,984
Now this isn't very interesting to set it

368
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:25,729
statically like that.

369
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,174
Ideally, you would be setting it

370
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,319
through some code behind operation

371
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,119
during the long-running operation.

372
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,279
But let me show you something really neat,

373
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,749
and let me just paste it in

374
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,329
and then I'll explain what it does in just a moment here.

375
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,284
I'm going to remove this Value="57"

376
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:44,989
and replace it with this strange syntax.

377
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,029
And then let's run the application

378
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,659
and I'll show you what it does.

379
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,784
So what I've done is I've bound

380
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:55,559
the current value of the ProgressBar

381
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,809
to whatever the value of the Slider is.

382
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,194
So notice as I move the Slider,

383
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:04,484
notice that I am also moving

384
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,689
the ProgressBar, okay?

385
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,254
So we're binding, data binding.

386
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:12,494
And binding statement, there is a new binding statement

387
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:16,619
new to the Universal Windows Platform,

388
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,624
and we'll talk about this in an upcoming lesson.

389
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,694
However, what we can do is say,

390
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:25,919
"Hey, you know that Slider, that Control called

391
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,319
"MySlider that I named up here?

392
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,904
"I want you to grab its value and bind to it."

393
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,749
Now this will be a one-way binding,

394
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,019
meaning that if I make any changes to the ProgressBar,

395
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,629
it will not reflect back to the Slider.

396
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,459
It's one way.

397
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,219
Any changes at the Slider will affect the ProgressBar,

398
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,289
but not vice versa, okay?

399
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,684
There is also other modes.

400
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,259
We'll talk about those later.

401
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,849
But this is just one of the kinds of things

402
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,624
that you can do with binding in XAML.

403
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:57,284
It's a very powerful feature that we'll be harnessing

404
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,019
frequently throughout the remainder of the series.

405
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,344
And then I guess the last thing that I want to talk about

406
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:05,809
is the ProgressRing, another type of progress.

407
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,684
This doesn't give the user

408
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:12,684
any specific feedback on how far we are through the process.

409
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,254
It's merely just displaying the fact that

410
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:19,129
something is in operation,

411
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,909
that something is going on and it's ongoing.

412
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,049
You see it's just a little ring,

413
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,194
it just goes up around and around and around

414
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:27,559
until we tell it to stop.

415
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,679
And so there's a method that allows us to start

416
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,629
and a method that will would us to stop,

417
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,339
or actually, a Property.

418
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,434
IsActive="True" or IsActive="False", okay?

419
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,624
All right, so hopefully you can see how these Controls

420
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,594
could be useful when building real applications,

421
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:46,994
whether they work with dates, whether we need

422
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:50,984
some contextual menus or some dialogs

423
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:53,789
to pop up, to notify the user of something,

424
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,519
to ask for some input.

425
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,014
We also looked at the AutoSuggestBox,

426
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,724
which will be huge when we create our own

427
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,649
search functionality and that hamburgers-style navigation.

428
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,984
We looked at the Slider Control,

429
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:07,764
which is used frequently in Windows 10,

430
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:11,979
especially in the Settings window.

431
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,384
And then finally, the ProgressBar

432
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:17,454
and the ProgressRing, okay?

433
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,924
So great.

434
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,209
More tools under our belt.

435
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,489
More tools in our toolbox that we can use

436
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,024
to build more powerful applications.

437
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,989
Let's continue on, keep building on this.

438
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,054
See you in the next lesson.

439
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:31,609
Thank you.
