1
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:07,296
<v ->Okay, so now it's time to have fun.</v>

2
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:09,078
We're going to actually wire up the

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:10,666
MediaElement to play the Sounds.

4
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:14,197
I'll also do a little clean up and get the filtering to work

5
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:16,405
by selecting one of the categories.

6
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:19,146
Only show those categories in the GridView.

7
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:20,810
So let's go ahead and get started here.

8
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:24,032
And I'm going to open up the MainPage.xaml

9
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:28,862
and in here what I want to do is handle the,

10
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:32,119
I think this is it, the ListView_ItemClick Event.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,035
Let me make sure that's the correct EventHandler.

12
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:36,734
So basically when somebody selects

13
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:41,504
one of the items in this SoundGridView

14
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:45,241
that we created, we want to play the sound

15
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:48,121
that's associated with the image that was clicked on.

16
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:52,899
So, actually, this is the EventHandler that we want.

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,339
SoundGridView_ItemClick.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,754
Let me go ahead and,

19
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,280
I think we don't need this one anymore.

20
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:02,349
If we do, we'll add it back.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,133
Alright, and so here it's pretty easy stuff.

22
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:09,357
All we need to do is grab the Item that was clicked on

23
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,415
and so that'll be given to us here

24
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,519
in this ItemClickEventArgs e.

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,252
And we can just choose the clicked Item and then

26
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:21,900
cast that to what it represents

27
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,268
which is a sound in our application.

28
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:26,170
So I can do something like this:

29
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:30,230
var sound equals ClickedItem, cast it to Sound,

30
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:33,208
and then we'll set, I think I called it

31
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,270
MyMediaElement.Source, and we'll just set it to

32
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,774
that Sounds audio file property.

33
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:46,464
Now, to do this, we actually need to give it a URI,

34
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:48,533
if you hover over, you can see the Source property

35
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:51,893
accepts a URI, which is a Uniform Resource Indicator,

36
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,541
and that's just going to be a location for the file.

37
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,040
Now, what we need to do, there's a couple

38
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,566
different ways to go about this.

39
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:03,349
I think the easiest way is just to specify the base URI.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,111
That will give us, like, the root of the project,

41
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:09,450
and then we can give it the actual audio file

42
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:14,450
that will contain that /Assets/Audio/Category/Sound.

43
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,367
So we'll just do this.BaseUri,

44
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:23,532
and then we'll use the sound.AudioFile

45
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,751
and, with any luck, this will actually work,

46
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:37,293
so let's see what we've got so far.

47
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:53,180
Alright, it's time for the moment of truth.

48
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:55,063
(laugh)

49
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:56,422
(siren)

50
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:57,772
(cow moos)

51
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,289
OK, so it was that easy.

52
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:02,956
That's all we needed to do to wire everything up, great.

53
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:04,762
Now, when we ran the application,

54
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,964
there were some other issues with layout,

55
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:08,408
with the hamburger navigation,

56
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:09,864
let's go ahead and fix some of those things,

57
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:11,796
because that's really what's holding us back now.

58
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:13,865
Let me take note of a few things,

59
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,697
rerunning the application here,

60
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:18,785
and we'll just address them little by little.

61
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,224
Alright, so you can see here that we've got some

62
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:25,630
issues with each of the ListView Items.

63
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:31,011
Well, the text needs to be moved down a little bit.

64
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,160
If we can move things to the left a bit,

65
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,443
that would be helpful, because we wanted to line up

66
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:38,038
with the hamburger icon.

67
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,488
So, generally, some spacing issues there.

68
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,817
As far as these items, they need to be

69
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:46,152
pushed off from the left hand side a bit,

70
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:48,018
because it's just it's just kind of running together here,

71
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,399
in that upper left-hand corner area.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,131
So let's work on those two things right now.

73
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:58,012
Let's go over to the the MainPage.xaml.

74
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,416
Now, as far as the MediaElement is concerned,

75
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,200
we're going to use it at length for another project,

76
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:08,691
and we're going to learn how to manipulate the sounds,

77
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:11,495
and how much of the sound to play,

78
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,945
how do we manipulate the volume so that it

79
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:16,924
nicely fades out, instead of abruptly ends.

80
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,812
When we get to another project

81
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:19,944
that we're going to work on together,

82
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:22,961
so this is really our introduction to the MediaElement.

83
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,497
It can also play videos,

84
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,842
which I don't think we're going to demonstrate

85
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:28,124
in this series, but if you take a look

86
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,182
at the previous series that I created

87
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:35,182
for 8.1, so Windows Phone 8.1 Development

88
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,698
for Absolute Beginners, I demo how to display

89
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,893
video, using the MediaElement.

90
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:46,127
Ok, so let's go up here to ListView,

91
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:49,913
and what we want to do first of all, is,

92
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,489
I'm going to separate

93
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,981
some of these on other lines.

94
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:10,951
One of the first things I want to try to do is

95
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:13,116
set a negative Margin, because I really want

96
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,568
that image to move to the left quite a bit.

97
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,358
And we've not talked about negative Margins.

98
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,907
Let's just try, like, -15,

99
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:27,163
and maybe then 10 on the top, 0

100
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:29,743
on the right and 10 on the bottom.

101
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:32,714
That should make things a little more interesting there.

102
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:35,103
And as far as the TextBlock, I think we need to set

103
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:40,103
the VerticalAlignment="Center", that should

104
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:42,068
move things down a little bit.

105
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,364
Let's see what kind of impact that has.

106
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:57,361
Alright, that definitely moved things over to the left,

107
00:05:57,362 --> 00:06:00,418
which is great, and it looks like we've centered the text.

108
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,122
That's good too. And the last thing,

109
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,812
It's a hard call, right? I think what we ultimately need

110
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:09,344
are these icons to be a tiny bit smaller,

111
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,009
and maybe that would fix some of the issues there.

112
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,198
So let's back off on this to a -10, and then

113
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,664
set the Height and the Width of

114
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,685
these just a tiny bit smaller there,

115
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,221
and maybe even create a little more

116
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:29,171
Height and more Margin between each of the items.

117
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,199
The other thing that I want to do now is

118
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,728
come over to this, in the Content area,

119
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,514
I want to, on that whole item, that whole Content area,

120
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,253
I want to push things out a little bit.

121
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:44,207
So I'm going to set the Margin on the left 20,

122
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,479
and then I'll just go zeros for the rest of this

123
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,920
until I get a chance to look at it a little bit.

124
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:50,703
See what we have there.

125
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:59,207
So you can see that this is a lot of tinkering,

126
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,713
just seeing 'Does that look right? What if we do this?'

127
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:06,044
I probably should even make those icons

128
00:07:06,045 --> 00:07:08,502
a bit smaller, they're still pretty large.

129
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,881
So, let me do that.

130
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,355
But I like the spacing here.

131
00:07:14,356 --> 00:07:16,265
We might even come down from the top a little bit.

132
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,029
So let's make those two adjustments.

133
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,268
Let's make the icons a tiny bit smaller,

134
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:26,268
so let's go, 35, and 35 here.

135
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,615
I'm going to reduce that back down to 10.

136
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,862
It was just a little bit too much

137
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,160
Margin on the top and bottom.

138
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:35,954
And the other thing that I wanted to do was,

139
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,032
here I'm going to set...

140
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,556
Let's try 20 from the top.

141
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:44,892
That should push that Grid down 20 from the top,

142
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,813
giving us a little more space there.

143
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,905
Alright, I feel a little better about that.

144
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,629
That might be a bit much, but, overall,

145
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,632
I like where we're going with this.

146
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:02,249
The next thing I want to do is get the menu

147
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,829
actually working, so it actually filters.

148
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,101
So let's work on that part right there.

149
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:11,548
And the ListView that we have

150
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,930
we're going to accept input from the

151
00:08:13,931 --> 00:08:18,044
MenuItemsListView_ItemClick EventHandler.

152
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:30,321
Here again, what I want to do is grab that Event Item

153
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:34,992
that was clicked on from the ItemClickEventArgs e,

154
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:38,821
so, once again, I'm going grab the e.ClickedItem.

155
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,318
I'm going to cast it, this time on a menuItem,

156
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,211
remember that was the class that represent

157
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,741
each of the items that we're Binding to.

158
00:08:44,742 --> 00:08:48,760
Then I'll do var menuItem equals

159
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,592
there we go. Great.

160
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,821
Now what we want to do here is

161
00:08:52,822 --> 00:08:56,564
"Filter on", by category.

162
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,057
Great.

163
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:00,589
So, we'll set the Category

164
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,349
I think we have a CategoryTextBox.

165
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,288
Nah, let's see what we call that.

166
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,806
Okay, CategoryTextBlock, let's grab that.

167
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,089
CategoryTextBlock.Text = menuItem.Category,

168
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,504
and we'll just do a ToString on that.

169
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:25,246
That should give us what we need there.

170
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,148
In this point we want to change our Sounds Collection,

171
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:36,533
remember that that is a ObservableCollection<Sound>,

172
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,038
and so what we're goign to want to to is

173
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,171
filter that, so we're going to call

174
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:44,884
the SoundManager.GetSoundsByCategory

175
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:48,211
this time, passing in our ObservableCollection<Sound>,

176
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,918
and then the Sound Categories.

177
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,180
So, menuItem.Category.

178
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,512
Alright, so that should give us what we need.

179
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,091
What's wrong here?

180
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:02,533
Oh, I see. We can't set it equal.

181
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:07,038
Sorry, I forgot how I designed that method.

182
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,333
And, I'm not even sure we need to do anything else.

183
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,808
I think that's the only two things we need to do,

184
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,633
so let's go ahead and try that.

185
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,112
So, lets say I only want Animals,

186
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:29,269
I only want Taunts, I only want Warnings.

187
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,733
I only want Cartoons, awesome.

188
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:32,999
OK, that works.

189
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:37,276
Now we want to get the BackButton to work.

190
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,857
Really, the BackButton should only be displayed

191
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,518
whenever we click on one of the Items.

192
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:52,958
so, really, at this point, we should say

193
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,659
"Hey, BackButton, go ahead and set your visibility

194
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,816
"equal to Visibility.Visible,

195
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:04,702
"otherwise, it should be set to

196
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:09,873
"Collapsed."

197
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:14,353
Alright, when we see all of the Items.

198
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,451
Alright, so let's try that, and let's see,

199
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,838
and I may have to adjust that.

200
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,223
I've kind of forgotten what I need to do there.

201
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:27,186
But, whenever we hit the BackButton,

202
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,639
what we want to do is actually go back to that.

203
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,403
to All Sounds.

204
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,572
So here we'll go

205
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,091
SoundManager.GetAllSounds,

206
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:43,522
and we'll just pass in our Sounds,

207
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,441
and we're going to tell that MenuItemsListView

208
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:51,575
MenuItemsListView.SelectedItem = null

209
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:54,813
MenuItemsListView.SelectedItem = null,

210
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,752
so nothing will be selected then.

211
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:59,031
It'll just be back to its original state.

212
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,992
And that's all we should have to do.

213
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:02,992
So let's see if that actually works.

214
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:16,710
OK, so all sounds initially, then we're going to say

215
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:18,405
"Hey, just give me the taunts."

216
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,251
Notice that the Back Button showed up.

217
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:23,538
I'm going to hit the Back Button.

218
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:27,315
I see we have some work to do here. We're not 100%.

219
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,969
We hit the BackButton, we want to go back to All Sounds.

220
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:46,015
And then we would also want to make that

221
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:52,412
BackButton.Visibility = Visibility.Collapsed.

222
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,327
Alright, so let's pay attention to that state

223
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:58,572
one more time here, specifically, that BackButton.

224
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:05,090
OK, we don't see a Back Button,

225
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:06,665
and we're viewing All Sounds.

226
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,674
Now we want to go Taunts

227
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:10,624
and then I'll hit Back Button All Sounds.

228
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,620
And we could implement this in a

229
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:17,160
more robust way and keep track of the

230
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:18,877
various Pages that were loaded in,

231
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:22,195
and then just call Navigation.GoBack,

232
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:23,774
but I'm not doing it that way.

233
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,970
The BackButton will just take us back to All Sounds.

234
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,463
So it's really just a matter

235
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,672
of how you want to implement it.

236
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,903
But I feel comfortable with this approach.

237
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:33,683
(loud siren)

238
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:34,536
Excuse me.

239
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:38,566
I actually scared myself to death.

240
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,660
I didn't realize I was going to make a sound, I forgot.

241
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:44,732
Alright, at so any rate, that's exciting stuff, right?

242
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,032
We made a lot of progress on this one, and I think

243
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,229
the next thing we're going to do is add some

244
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,422
drag-and-drop functionality.

245
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:51,957
That will be interesting.

246
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,363
So we'll be able to take a sound off of our desktop,

247
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:58,299
and drag-and-drop it in, and then hear it.

248
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,098
And add it to the List, and then actually hear it.

249
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:02,253
So that'll be a big one.

250
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:03,997
We'll do that in the next lesson. Thanks.
