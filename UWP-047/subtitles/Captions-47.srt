1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,109
<v Voiceover>Ok, so the next task is to create</v>      

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,429
User Control and use that as the DataTemplate      

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,270
so we'll rip out      

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,081
everything that we did here and actually,      

5
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:21,750
in the process we'll fix it and make it look better.      

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,270
So to get started here,      

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,219
let's go ahead and select the Project      

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,679
and then go over to the Project Menu      

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,269
and select Add New Item and we wanna choose      

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,419
a User Control and we're going to call this      

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,719
the news item control, you can call it anything you want.      

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,910
NewsItemControl.      

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,260
Good, good.      

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,279
All right and inside of the NewsItemControl,      

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,189
for the most part, I'm just going to grab everything out      

16
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,549
that I did here.      

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,250
So the Grid, Control+"X" and      

18
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,119
paste it over the Grid in the NewsItemControl.xaml.      

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,990
So that's one of the first steps that we'll need to take.      

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,489
The next thing that we'll need to do is      

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,889
to reference that Control so let's go ahead      

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,189
and I think what we do here is just      

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,880
local NewsItemControl, right?      

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,559
Then I think what we're going to have to do      

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,149
in order to continue to use the x:Bind      

26
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,979
is we have to make some changes to this.      

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,149
So first of all, let me go to the Code Behind      

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,860
for the NewsItemControl.      

29
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,759
You remember, there were two things      

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,549
that we needed to do here.      

31
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,550
First of all, we need to      

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,919
do something like this, public Model.NewsItem      

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,330
Model.NewsItem NewsItem.      

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,349
And let's do a getter on this, right?      

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,120
So, get      

36
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,389
and we'll return this.DataContext      

37
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,230
as Model.NewsItem.      

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,789
And that was all very templated, you could      

39
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,589
pull that directly from the cheat sheet.      

40
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,589
Then, we just needed to handle the      

41
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,959
DataContextChanged Event.      

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,410
And we'll do this little lambda here.      

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,810
And tell the bindings      

44
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,749
that we have inside of our XAML to update themselves      

45
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,519
whenever the DataContext changes.      

46
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,199
So then back here in NewsItemControl,      

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,430
what we'll need to do is to      

48
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,599
set the x:Bind to NewsItem.Image      

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,250
and NewsItem.Headline      

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,419
NewsItem.Headline and ".Subhead" and ".DateLine".      

51
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,640
Great.      

52
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,249
And also while we're here, I'm going to go ahead      

53
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,349
and fix the alignment issues.      

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,819
So in this Headline TextBlock, I'm going to go      

55
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,890
RelativePanel.AlignTopWithPanel.      

56
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,329
There we go, equals "True".      

57
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,969
And I'm going to make the FontSize a little bit larger.      

58
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,959
At least initially.      

59
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,219
And we'll turn on TextWrapping.      

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,219
I don't think I told you to do this but      

61
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,713
we're going to need that.      

62
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:45,349
Let me go ahead and put all this on separate lines      

63
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,409
so you can easily see it here inside the viewable area.      

64
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,589
So the next item, the Subhead, we'll set it      

65
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,719
as the RelativePanel.Below      

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,449
the Headline TextBox.      

67
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,749
Oh, I didn't give this a name.      

68
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,480
So let's give that the name      

69
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,909
HeadlineTextBox.      

70
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,280
So, we should be able to do this now.      

71
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,980
Great      

72
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,350
I'm going to set its TextWrapping      

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,610
as well to "Wrap".      

74
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,249
And then finally, this bottom DateLine,      

75
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,109
I'm going to put that Aligned with the bottom      

76
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,089
so RelativePanelAlignBottomWithPanel      

77
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,610
RelativePanelAlignBottomWithPanel="True".      

78
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,610
Let's set the FontSize, something kind of small here,      

79
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,610
to like 10.      

80
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,249
And that should be all we need to do there.      

81
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,350
So at least that should space things out nicely.      

82
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,519
Let's see if this works.      

83
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,720
If I've forgotten a step in this process.      

84
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,969
I forgot something.      

85
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,600
Oh, yeah.      

86
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,789
So I forgot a end of line statement.      

87
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,889
This is kind of an odd line of code to write.      

88
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,269
It's all on one line, we're used to      

89
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,099
seeing things on different lines.      

90
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,970
I'll forgive myself if you do. (laughs very softly)      

91
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,720
Hey hey, it works.      

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,870
And just out of curiosity, I'm going to do something here.      

93
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,389
Let me resize this window, it's a little ungainly.      

94
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,410
Alright and we get the scroll bar so that's good.      

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,149
Awesome.      

96
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,749
You know what, I think we need is the      

97
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,249
BackgroundColor for this to be the light gray.      

98
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,250
So let me go to this...      

99
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,919
To the MainPage.xaml and here in the GridView,      

100
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,710
and let's set the Background="LightGray".      

101
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,200
And let's see what that looks like.      

102
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,419
It definitely has some padding issues in this guy,      

103
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,689
inside of each of these items so let's go ahead      

104
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,250
and add some padding.      

105
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,950
We're on that RelativePanel in particular.      

106
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,649
So in NewsItemControl, find the RelativePanel.      

107
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,389
Here, I'm going to set the Margin      

108
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,780
and I'll set a "10" on all sides.      

109
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,630
That should work.      

110
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,770
That's a little bit better.      

111
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,260
I like where we're going with this.      

112
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,509
So I think that's all we really needed to do      

113
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,649
for this lesson.      

114
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,319
We created the User Control, used it as DataTemplate,      

115
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,149
styled it up a little bit better and it's looking great.      

116
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,630
There's, I think, only one step left and that is to      

117
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,409
add in the StateManagement      

118
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,049
for the different State Triggers, Adapative Triggers.      

119
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,719
So let's tackle that in the last of the solution videos      

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,920
and see you in the next video, thanks.
