1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,885
<v Voiceover>Okay, so here we are in</v>      

2
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:09,750
the final of the Solution Videos      

3
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,698
for the Adeptly Adaptive Challenge,      

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,911
and there are two things we need to accomplish here.      

5
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:20,912
Each news item should be 200 X 275 in narrow state,      

6
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:24,171
and 400 X 400 tall when in a wide state.      

7
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:25,742
And here we're defining the wide state      

8
00:00:25,743 --> 00:00:28,087
as 900 min window width.      

9
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:31,786
In the narrow state, the Headline should be 18 point,      

10
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:34,055
and 26 point in the wide state.      

11
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:36,615
And then also we're going to hide the AutoSuggestBox      

12
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:40,166
when in a narrow state of 400 or less.      

13
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:44,665
Okay, so this will apply really      

14
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,286
only to the MainPage.xaml.      

15
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:51,022
This will only apply to our User Control that we created.      

16
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:53,572
The NewsItemControl.      

17
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:57,512
So let's go ahead and get started here,      

18
00:00:57,513 --> 00:01:01,052
and let's open up the NewsItemControl.      

19
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:06,058
And inside of our Grid,      

20
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:08,488
right after the GridRowDefinitions, we're going to      

21
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:10,878
start adding a VisualStateManager,      

22
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,531
creating the VisualState groups,      

23
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:19,881
and we'll create one VisualState group.      

24
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:23,051
And inside that we'll create two VisualStates.      

25
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:27,111
The first one I'm going to call the NarrowLayout,      

26
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,041
(typing on keyboard)      

27
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:32,064
and then the second one      

28
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:35,135
I'll call WideLayout.      

29
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:40,292
Not that it really matters,      

30
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,952
because we're not referencing it by name.      

31
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:43,212
But any rate, okay,      

32
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:47,811
and then, here we go, VisualState.StateTriggers,      

33
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:52,558
and then VisualState.Setters.      

34
00:01:55,128 --> 00:01:59,078
and I'll just copy and paste that here as well.      

35
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,042
All right, so in the Triggers, I'm going to      

36
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:04,789
create an AdaptiveTrigger where      

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,012
the MinWindowWidth      

38
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:12,232
will be "0" for the NarrowLayout.      

39
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,172
(typing)      

40
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:19,080
And then we'll make this MinwindowWidth      

41
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:22,460
"900" in the WideLayout.      

42
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,240
And remember this is really on a per app basis.      

43
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,800
Whatever makes sense for your application,      

44
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:29,870
where the logical breaks are.      

45
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:32,874
So there's no like as I've said many times already,      

46
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,854
there's no standard way to do this that I'm aware of.      

47
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,655
I might be corrected as some point here, but...      

48
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,216
(typing)      

49
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,782
So we're going to set that      

50
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:46,522
MainPanel.Width,      

51
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:47,613
and let's make sure that we have      

52
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:50,625
that's called MainPanel here.      

53
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:52,299
Here I want to call this...      

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,853
Give this Name...      

55
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:58,863
MainPanel.      

56
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:01,633
Okay? So we're going to set...      

57
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:05,153
(typing on keyboard)      

58
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:07,864
(typing)      

59
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:10,422
(typing)      

60
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,553
(typing)      

61
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:15,933
(typing)      

62
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:18,482
(typing)      

63
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:22,542
the MainPanel's Width to a value of 200.      

64
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:27,543
(typing)      

65
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:31,832
And the MainPanel.Height      

66
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,312
(typing)      

67
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,782
equal to 275.      

68
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,440
Now keep in mind, this is just for (mumbles)      

69
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,688
the individual newsItems inside of our GridView.      

70
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,178
(takes a deep breath)      

71
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:45,645
And then the other requirement was      

72
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:47,880
to...      

73
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,510
(typing)      

74
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,140
set the...      

75
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:52,751
HeadlineTextBlock      

76
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:57,401
HeadlineTextBlock...      

77
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,690
Right?      

78
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,169
(typing)      

79
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,418
.FontSize,      

80
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,455
so the value equal to 18 there.      

81
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:08,685
Let me make sure I have that name set.      

82
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:13,079
Yeah, I do. HeadlineTextBlock. Great. Okay.      

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,927
HeadlineText, did I say box? That should be Block.      

84
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:21,657
There we go.      

85
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:23,331
Boy, it did not like that.      

86
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,093
Oh.      

87
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:30,102
(typing)      

88
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,392
That (mumbles), yeah. It just didn't like that.      

89
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:37,393
Okay, good alright, so then we'll change      

90
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:41,680
each of these Setters up      

91
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,100
when we go to the wide size.      

92
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:46,444
And so in this case we want 400 X 400,      

93
00:04:46,445 --> 00:04:49,199
and...      

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,568
we'll set this Font at 26.      

95
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:54,479
(typing)      

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,943
Great.      

97
00:04:55,944 --> 00:05:00,644
So that should complete the first of the two...      

98
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,405
items.      

99
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:06,431
Now let's go over to the MainPage.xaml,      

100
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:08,357
and we're going to need to add      

101
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:12,387
a VisualStateManager.      

102
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:13,549
In fact, let me just do this.      

103
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,247
Because I hate typing all this stuff out.      

104
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:19,468
Just grab all this, we'll strip out the stuff we don't need.      

105
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,699
(typing)      

106
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,335
Alright, so we'll just get rid of these Setters,      

107
00:05:28,336 --> 00:05:33,336
and I think the MinWindowWidth is going to be 400, any rate.      

108
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,480
(sighing)      

109
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:39,680
And so in this case what we're going to do      

110
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:42,535
is set the MyAutoSuggestBox.Visibility      

111
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:43,745
MyAutoSuggestBox.Visibility      

112
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:47,535
MyAutoSuggestBox.Visibility      

113
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:50,075
MyAutoSuggestBox.Visibility      

114
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,856
and we'll set that equal to Collapsed.      

115
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,706
(typing)      

116
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:57,617
And then we'll do the same here,      

117
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:00,547
(typing)      

118
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:02,227
and it should be set to Visible,      

119
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:06,038
I believe is the property there.      

120
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:11,258
Alright. Let's save it, and let's see what we got.      

121
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:19,719
Alright, here goes nothing. Oh yeah, look at that.      

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,698
Font got bigger. The entire size of the item got larger.      

123
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:29,396
All right, now unfortunately      

124
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:31,916
we can't really go smaller than 400.      

125
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,585
At least I can't, so to test this,      

126
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:37,716
what we're going to do...      

127
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:40,233
is change to the Mobile Emulator.      

128
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:46,451
And test it there.      

129
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:50,323
And ideally that SuggestBox will not be visible.      

130
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:56,622
And you can see it is not visible.      

131
00:06:56,623 --> 00:07:00,482
I do have a little bit of... a little something      

132
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:04,302
I want to do up there with that TextBlock, up on top.      

133
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:09,262
Let me play around with that real quick,      

134
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,002
but other than that, I think we're pretty much done.      

135
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,902
Yeah, I think it was too close to the top,      

136
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:16,646
so all I wanna do      

137
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:19,764
is change the Margin a little bit.      

138
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:23,803
Push it down there and then      

139
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:28,232
let's see what the text...      

140
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:30,483
That AutoSuggestBox, I'm going to have a closer eye      

141
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,683
at that too, cause I didn't pay attention to that.      

142
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,162
Alright, it does sit up a little high.      

143
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,423
I might push that down 5px.      

144
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:48,064
So, push it down 5px.      

145
00:07:48,124 --> 00:07:49,744
Yeah, I like that better.      

146
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:51,664
Okay, looks good.      

147
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:55,144
Let me just make sure that there wasn't some other item.      

148
00:07:55,145 --> 00:07:58,844
Got that. Got that.      

149
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:03,546
Got that. Did all that.      

150
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:08,066
Screenshots, got it, (mumbles) okay, NewsItem, got it.      

151
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:12,756
And I think we did all of that.      

152
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:15,287
For the most part, I think we're in good shape.      

153
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:18,088
Okay, great, that's all there was to it.      

154
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,787
Hope you got it, or at least if you didn't get      

155
00:08:20,788 --> 00:08:25,188
it fist time around, that this helped you get unstuck.      

156
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:29,049
Alright, let's move on see you in the next video, thanks.
