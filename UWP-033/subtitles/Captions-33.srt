1
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:06,334
<v Voiceover>Okay, so next up in the</v>

2
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:09,064
Stupendous Styles Challenge solution we're going to

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:10,909
tackle navigation.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,064
And then work on the Donut Page.

5
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:14,546
So the first thing I'm going to do is

6
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,911
go down to the Button section,

7
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:17,577
add Click Events for each of the Buttons.

8
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:19,378
I want to give each Button a name

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,378
so I'll set the Name of this one to "DonutButton"

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,295
and then we'll go on the Click Events

11
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:29,661
we'll just create a new EventHandler

12
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,381
and that'll be named appropriately.

13
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:36,166
So I'm going to put these on different lines.

14
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,649
And I like putting things on different lines like this

15
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,579
it makes things more readable for me.

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,809
If you don't then let it go off

17
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,579
to the end of the screen if you like.

18
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,531
Alright so I'm just going to repeat this process.

19
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:46,705
I'm setting the Name,

20
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,795
so "CoffeeButton",

21
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:52,027
and then Click equals new EventHandler.

22
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:54,495
(clicking noises)

23
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,221
Button Name="ScheduleButton"

24
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:05,823
Button Name="ScheduleButton", and Click equals...

25
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:16,057
Okay and then,

26
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:18,334
(clicking noises)

27
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:32,984
Okay so we should be good to go there.

28
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:35,395
I wanna make sure that I gave the Frame a Name.

29
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:38,339
I did. Good.

30
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,516
Alright next up, let me go here

31
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,076
to the DonutButton.

32
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:45,901
And whenever somebody clicks it,

33
00:01:45,902 --> 00:01:50,901
we'll go MyFrame.Navigate(typeof(DonutPage));

34
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:56,181
MyFrame.Navigate(typeof(DonutPage));

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,649
Great.

36
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,157
Now I'll just copy that four times

37
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:06,646
and we'll change out the Page.

38
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:09,890
And I guess I'll put it here too

39
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:11,680
in the constructor for the Page itself

40
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:14,144
so it automatically navigates to the DonutPage.

41
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:17,429
But here in the CoffeeButton

42
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,403
we'll want to put it to the CoffeePage,

43
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:21,898
schedule to the SchedulePage,

44
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:24,906
CompleteButton to the CompletePage.

45
00:02:24,907 --> 00:02:28,612
And now let's test this.

46
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:35,210
Well, it's going to be hard to know

47
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:37,386
because we don't have anything on those pages,

48
00:02:37,387 --> 00:02:39,167
but let's go ahead and assume for the moment

49
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,351
that it actually works.

50
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:42,366
And move on to the DonutPage.

51
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:47,366
So if you take a look at the comp for this.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,174
Here we go, let's open this up.

53
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:55,383
And then take a look at this.

54
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,775
You're going to notice that we have the logo,

55
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:00,503
two TextBlocks, and next to the TextBlocks

56
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:03,042
we're going to have two Slider Controls.

57
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:06,167
So this looks to me like a two by two Grid,

58
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:07,809
maybe a two by,

59
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,092
well actually two by three or four Grid.

60
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:11,873
We'll wanna put a fourth row just to take up

61
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:14,134
all this extra space and force everything

62
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,862
and push it up to the top.

63
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,387
Alright so to do this,

64
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:20,832
let us go back here to Visual Studio

65
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,990
and get this back to the recording area.

66
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:27,136
Okay so let's do this

67
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:31,940
Grid dot... I know what I want,

68
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:36,522
one, two, three, four Rows

69
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:41,522
so let's go RowDefinition Height="Auto"

70
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,647
for all of them except the last one.

71
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:46,601
So I'll just copy and paste that a couple times.

72
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,344
And then in the last one I'll change that to "*" sizing

73
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:50,985
and that should push everything up.

74
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:54,196
And then we'll go Grid.ColumnDefinitions,

75
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:55,657
and I'm going to create two Columns.

76
00:03:55,658 --> 00:04:00,657
So Grid dot, actually ColumnDefinition Width="Auto"

77
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:06,022
ColumnDefinition Width="Auto",

78
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,120
so that'll be for the width of the

79
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:15,120
the labels and then we actually need to do a "*"

80
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:23,727
we actually need to do a "*" width

81
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:25,252
on that second Column.

82
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:29,775
Otherwise, our Slider Controls aren't going to look right.

83
00:04:29,776 --> 00:04:34,009
So let's start with the Image for the logo.

84
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,531
So, Assets,

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,377
whoops,

86
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,572
so let's start with the

87
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:53,141
the logo, so "Assets/white-logo.png".

88
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,102
And then we're going to go with two TextBlocks

89
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,641
for the labels.

90
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:01,975
Well actually let me go ahead and

91
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:06,592
set to Grid.Row="1".

92
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:11,592
I know that the FontSize is going to be 18.

93
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:16,245
We're going to go with the Text on this one

94
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:21,245
is "Original Glazed Count:" I believe.

95
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:24,757
I know the color,

96
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:28,714
so the Foreground is going to be "White".

97
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,932
And I know there's going to be some padding,

98
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,737
and I'm just going to guess from what I saw earlier

99
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:38,737
that I originally did something like "20, 20, 20, 0".

100
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,009
Let's see what that looks like

101
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,396
then we'll move on from there.

102
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:46,396
Alright so the second of these is going to be

103
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:52,443
"Speedway Special Count:".

104
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,152
Kind of going with branding that

105
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,312
driving or racing theme.

106
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:01,858
Since after all they are "Gonuts".

107
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:04,008
Alright good.

108
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,062
Now I need Sliders.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,378
Grid.Row="1"

110
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:14,694
Grid.Column="1"

111
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:18,247
I know that the Maximum

112
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:19,185
is going to be 24,

113
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:20,785
remember that was one of the requirements.

114
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:23,366
And let's look at the Margin,

115
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:28,366
let's go with the same thing as we did with the other one.

116
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:33,877
I think we need it to go there.

117
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:39,039
Actually this should be Row 2 here on that TextBlock.

118
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,567
Alright let's see what we have so far.

119
00:06:51,568 --> 00:06:54,031
I know this Image is going to be way too large.

120
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:55,631
And it's going to be a problem.

121
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,212
So let's set the Width="150"

122
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:00,697
I think is going to be the right Width.

123
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,766
And I know we need some margin here as well.

124
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:07,766
So let's do 20 left, 20, and then 0, 0.

125
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,594
Whoa, okay.

126
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,258
This is not bad.

127
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:21,805
The only thing is I forgot

128
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,831
to set the Background of the Grid.

129
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:28,119
So let's change it to "Red".

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,350
And then rerun.

131
00:07:36,002 --> 00:07:39,094
Okay.

132
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:41,730
That's pretty much what I had in mind.

133
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:43,766
Alright so I think that part's complete.

134
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,409
Let's go ahead, stop now,

135
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,403
and we'll pick it back up in the next one

136
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:48,641
which should be the CoffeePage.

137
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,774
It's going to be a little more involved.
