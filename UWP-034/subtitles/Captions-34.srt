1
00:00:05,757 --> 00:00:09,329
<v Voiceover>Okay, so this is the coffee page step of the</v>

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,190
Stupendous Styles Challenge Solution.

3
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:15,423
If you take a look at the screenshot I gave you,

4
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:19,397
brown background, three buttons that have

5
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:21,996
a background style, looks like,

6
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:25,429
we'll need to work on that somehow.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,383
Looks like we have one, two, three rows,

8
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:31,121
and then I know we're going to have another row here,

9
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:33,580
that'll just push everything up.

10
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,498
With star sizing.

11
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:37,957
Actually you could do this a number of ways.

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:41,112
I think I just centered these three together.

13
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:43,803
I think I put them in a StackPanel,

14
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,257
and then centered the StackPanel,

15
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:47,376
so any way you want it, just move them over,

16
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:48,721
that's fine with me.

17
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:51,350
Looks like we're going to use the same spacing,

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,588
the same graphic and everything,

19
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:55,588
so for the logo, so that might be a perfect

20
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,537
opportunity to create another style,

21
00:00:57,538 --> 00:01:00,104
a style at the application level.

22
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:03,197
And looks like we have some text here as well,

23
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,600
we might be able to borrow that from the previous,

24
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,600
from the previous video, and put that in the

25
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,688
application level style as well.

26
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,900
So let's go ahead and get started here.

27
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,761
You can see in the instructions we get

28
00:01:16,762 --> 00:01:19,963
quite a bit of instruction around this.

29
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:23,504
In number six, the flyout menu contents.

30
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:26,567
What I want to do right now is work with this right here.

31
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:30,491
Grab that color, and we'll,

32
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:32,842
in the coffeepage.xaml,

33
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,208
I'm going change that first of all.

34
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,528
So I know I'm going to need

35
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:40,559
just rows for my implementation,

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,338
you might use columns, that's fine.

37
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:47,287
Let's do grid.rowdefinitions.

38
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:52,256
Or definition height

39
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:55,256
equals auto.

40
00:01:55,257 --> 00:02:00,097
And then do one, two, three of those,

41
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:03,747
then on the fourth one we'll do star sizing, okay?

42
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,428
Very good.

43
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:08,722
So I know I'm going to need my image.

44
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,949
Now at this point, I have a decision to make.

45
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,275
Do I basically copy and paste from the donut page?

46
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:18,079
Or do I take the step of grabbing out

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,374
all this stuff, 'cause I'm going to reuse it all,

48
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,740
and putting that into a style, so let's do that.

49
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,719
I'm going to go to the app.xaml.

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,266
I know I'm going to use it on multiple pages,

51
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:29,462
so this is the right place for it.

52
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:32,757
And we'll create a resource section and create a new style,

53
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:36,700
and this will be, the target type will be image.

54
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:41,108
And then the key equals

55
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:44,341
white logo style.

56
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:45,593
Probably could come up with a

57
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:47,511
slightly better name than that.

58
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:50,805
I'm actually going to paste in what I have in my clipboard.

59
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,570
Setter, property,

60
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,292
and value.

61
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:10,596
All right, source.

62
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,745
With.

63
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,931
It's going to be what, 150?

64
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,333
And then the margin.

65
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,616
20, 20, 20, zero, and then finally...

66
00:03:32,665 --> 00:03:36,184
That, and...

67
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,250
Let's try it here.

68
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:52,870
This should give us what we want there,

69
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:54,046
I'll come back to that in a minute.

70
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:57,281
I know also that I'm going to grab this,

71
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,245
start from the TextBlock,

72
00:03:59,246 --> 00:04:01,086
and create a style out of that as well.

73
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,697
So I'm going to grab...

74
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:07,024
The font size, foreground, and margin.

75
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,437
And I'll go to the app.xaml.

76
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,651
And I'll just call this style...

77
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,044
TextBlock.

78
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,305
We're going to call that...

79
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,646
LabelTextBlockStyle.

80
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:30,450
Again, naming things is so hard.

81
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:34,484
So if you want to name it something

82
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,773
a little more descriptive, please,

83
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:39,154
please, be my guest.

84
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,920
Font size.

85
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:43,800
18.

86
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,735
and foreground.

87
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:56,540
White and then margin.

88
00:04:57,977 --> 00:04:59,492
And that'll be

89
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:02,276
20, 20, 20, 0

90
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,920
All right, that should be good, let's correct that.

91
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:13,101
And I want to start using these all replace.

92
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:15,498
So here on the donut place,

93
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:18,112
let's get rid of

94
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:19,341
a lot of this stuff.

95
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:25,884
And I'm going to set the style equal to

96
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:28,176
static resource.

97
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:36,254
Great.

98
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,394
We'll just grab that out here.

99
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,884
And then use it here as well.

100
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:49,756
Okay.

101
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,584
And then...

102
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:56,069
Style here.

103
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,207
Static resource.

104
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,831
Nice.

105
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,269
All right.

106
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,468
So before we go any further, let me...

107
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:11,564
Just make sure that it compiles.

108
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:14,827
That nothing changed with our donut page,

109
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:17,534
and that our coffee page is off to a good start.

110
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:21,122
It looks like I need to create another setter

111
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:23,738
to set the horizontal alignment left so...

112
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,311
Let's go here.

113
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:30,342
And...

114
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:36,418
Horizontal alignment value left.

115
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,109
And that should take care of that issue.

116
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,795
And we'll look at that next time we run it.

117
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:43,285
Okay, back to the coffee page.

118
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:45,574
Yeah.

119
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:48,837
So in this case, I know I'm going to need buttons.

120
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,965
I need three of them.

121
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,594
Oh, and these buttons are special buttons, right?

122
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:57,668
So I can't just do the self-enclosing there, I need that.

123
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,063
And...

124
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,308
These buttons are going to have flyouts, right?

125
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:04,736
So flyout.

126
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:08,943
And then we want a menu flyout.

127
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:11,124
And then we want

128
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,977
MenuFlyoutItems

129
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,697
And here's where we use those lists.

130
00:07:20,698 --> 00:07:22,986
Now I just happen to have them offscreen,

131
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:25,445
so I can see them here.

132
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,801
But I'm going to basically do that.

133
00:07:30,987 --> 00:07:32,673
And...

134
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,362
We'll set the content equal to "Roast" on this one.

135
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:39,390
I'm going to set the...

136
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,481
I'm going to set margin to 10 all the way around.

137
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:46,749
So I'm just going to set it once,

138
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,002
I don't know if I should do that technique,

139
00:07:48,003 --> 00:07:50,430
but when you set it once, it'll set 10

140
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:53,353
on all four sides, just FYI.

141
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:55,912
And then the foreground of this button is

142
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:57,969
going to need to be white.

143
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,805
And that reminds me what I wanted to put them inside,

144
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:03,599
it was a StackPanel, so let's go ahead and

145
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,718
set that up as well.

146
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,289
And the StackPanel's going to be in row two.

147
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,610
So grid.row equals one.

148
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:18,943
And I recall telling you that I set the horizontal alignment

149
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:21,634
center on that, so let's go ahead and set that as well.

150
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,923
Oh yeah, and,

151
00:08:23,924 --> 00:08:27,187
we need to set the orientation to horizontal as well.

152
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:30,821
Great, okay, we're off to a good start here.

153
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,778
Now, since one of the requirements was

154
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,696
to use styles as often as possible,

155
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:43,016
I'm going to use a gratuitous style here.

156
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,522
Don't really need a style here, honestly.

157
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:47,830
But I'm going to use one anyway.

158
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,565
So...

159
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,912
Page.resources.

160
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:56,496
And we're going to have the style.

161
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:01,272
Type, whoops.

162
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:05,049
Target type button.

163
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:09,425
And the key will be...

164
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,898
Flyout button style?

165
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:16,847
Again I could probably come up with

166
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,161
a much better name than that.

167
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,760
So then we need some setters.

168
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,815
Just going to paste that right there.

169
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:28,096
Property and value.

170
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:36,077
Set the margin, 10.

171
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,737
And then the foreground.

172
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,864
It's going to be white.

173
00:09:51,143 --> 00:09:55,689
And now we can use the flyout button style, nice.

174
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,714
So style equals static resource.

175
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,405
Button style.

176
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:08,499
Okay, great.

177
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,807
So I need three of these.

178
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,046
And you know what, I think,

179
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,762
oh, I've got the margin already, I'm good.

180
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:19,170
So let's grab one, two, and three.

181
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:23,284
The second one will be, what, sweetener?

182
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:28,409
And then the third one will be for...

183
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:32,103
Cream.

184
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:35,568
All right, so now what we're going to do is

185
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,913
change the text on each of these,

186
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:38,522
so this is going to be dark,

187
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:41,599
and this is going to be medium.

188
00:10:44,682 --> 00:10:48,285
All right, then next up we want to go sweeteners none,

189
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:52,600
and sugar, and we'll get rid of the third menu flyout item.

190
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:56,784
And then the last one will be 2% milk,

191
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:59,382
and whole milk.

192
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:03,917
All right, and then what I want to do is add

193
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,577
click event handlers, but I'm going to kind of group them

194
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:10,011
together so each of the three, or two menu items,

195
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:13,212
flyout items will have the same click event handlers.

196
00:11:13,213 --> 00:11:16,677
So click equals, and I want to create this myself,

197
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:19,012
I want to call this Roast_Click.

198
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,848
And I'll just copy this for all three.

199
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:28,728
And then we'll do the same thing with the sweetener.

200
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:33,476
Except we're going to rename this to sweetener.

201
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,473
And...

202
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:42,744
And then finally, Cream_Click.

203
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:05,280
All right, let's put our mouse cursor in

204
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:09,116
the new name of the new event, and hit F12,

205
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:12,116
to create that stub.

206
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:15,689
In our code behind.

207
00:12:19,328 --> 00:12:21,993
Great, we'll come back to this in just a moment.

208
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,957
We've got a little bit of unfinished business here,

209
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,282
in the XAML, oh, in the coffee page xaml.

210
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:30,917
And that is that below all of this, I want to add

211
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:34,923
the, you know the coffee,

212
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:39,717
little label there, so StackPanel.

213
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,264
And I'm going to put these

214
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:47,793
in an orientation equal to horizontal,

215
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:51,830
and this will be in Grid.Row equal two.

216
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:55,140
And so I'm going to have two TextBlocks.

217
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,736
And the first one will be just static.

218
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:04,171
Coffee.

219
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:07,806
And I'm going to reuse one of the styles, since again,

220
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:10,296
that is really the point of all of this.

221
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:13,442
Static resource label

222
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:16,444
TextBlockStyle, perfect.

223
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:20,319
And then the second TextBlock will be,

224
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,407
we'll give it a name because we're going to want to

225
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:24,525
access it programmatically.

226
00:13:24,526 --> 00:13:28,029
And then style equals,

227
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,122
and we'll do the same static resource

228
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:33,720
label TextBlockStyle.

229
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,179
And I think that's all I need to do there.

230
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,669
So we should be in good shape on that side of things.

231
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,427
All right, so in the coffee page, here's what we want to do.

232
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:45,585
My thought is that...

233
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:49,774
In each of these cases we're going to

234
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,527
retrieve off what was selected,

235
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:56,069
and then we want to rebuild that result

236
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,559
that we'll put in the ResultTextBlock.

237
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,905
So when I, I think all three of these methods need to call

238
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:06,539
a common helper method to do the assembly

239
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,307
of that resultMessage.

240
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:12,976
So I'll just do a private void

241
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,177
displayResult.

242
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,033
Like so.

243
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,075
We'll get to that in a moment, but here's kind of

244
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:22,240
how each of these will work.

245
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,498
We're going to use the routedEventArgs

246
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:28,395
for the click event, to determine which menu item

247
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:31,055
was the one that was selected, so here we go.

248
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:34,860
var selected equals sender.

249
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,840
I'm sorry, we're not going to use event args,

250
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:38,031
we're going to use the sender,

251
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:40,150
that will tell us which one was clicked.

252
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:41,495
Okay, sorry about that.

253
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:44,697
And then we'll say, we'll cast it to

254
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:46,784
of type MenuFlyoutItem.

255
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,769
Now we should have what we need.

256
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,368
But I'm going to need to pass some data

257
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,023
to this display result.

258
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,636
So since I need to kind of keep state

259
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:59,065
across all three of these button clicks,

260
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,921
I'm going to add some private variables,

261
00:15:03,922 --> 00:15:06,864
so we'll do something like this.

262
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,957
Roast, and you'll see how I use this in just a minute here,

263
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,987
so you might be like, "What?

264
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:14,168
"What are you doing here?"

265
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:16,225
Trust me.

266
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,483
Okay.

267
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,803
So here's what we do now.

268
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:28,979
We set the roast equal to the selected.Text

269
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,391
of the MenuFlyoutItem, right?

270
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:34,191
And then we'll call that displayResult.

271
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:38,196
So now we just follow this pattern two more times.

272
00:15:38,197 --> 00:15:42,852
So I'm copying and pasting, but what we grab off,

273
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,373
is different each time, right?

274
00:15:45,374 --> 00:15:47,553
This time we want sweetener.

275
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:50,523
Is that how I spelled it?

276
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,939
Sweet, sweeter (laughs).

277
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,792
En-er, yeah, looks weird, but that is correct I guess.

278
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:01,338
And then the cream.

279
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:03,132
Great.

280
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:07,710
Now in displayResult, what we want to do is,

281
00:16:07,711 --> 00:16:11,608
ultimately, kind of add

282
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:14,886
all of that stuff together, ResultTextBlock.Text

283
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:18,181
equals you know, coffee.

284
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:21,305
Or I'm sorry, _roast.

285
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:22,576
Plus...

286
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:27,105
_sweetener

287
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:30,801
Plus _cream, but it's really not that easy,

288
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:33,492
we've gotta take a few extra steps here.

289
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,164
All right, first up.

290
00:16:42,992 --> 00:16:47,429
If the _roast is either none or if

291
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,713
that _roast string is empty, it hasn't been populated yet,

292
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:55,518
then we want to set the ResultTextBlock

293
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,617
to the word "None", because you can't just have

294
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,710
sweetener and cream without some coffee selected.

295
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:05,370
And then we're just going to exit out of this displayResult.

296
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:08,773
So if _roast

297
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:12,515
is equal to the string "None"

298
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:15,748
or (and this is one of my favorite

299
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:18,439
little methods, I don't know why, I just love it.

300
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,836
It's gotten me out of-- it just is an elegant way

301
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:23,790
of handling this situation.)

302
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,677
_roast

303
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:29,312
Then we're going to set the ResultTextBlockText,

304
00:17:29,313 --> 00:17:31,833
equal to "None".

305
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:35,885
And then we'll just return out of this method, great.

306
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:40,633
All right, so then assuming that we were able to

307
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:43,246
make sure that

308
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:46,046
there's at least something in _roast,

309
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:49,417
we'll go ahead and set the ResultTextBlock.Text

310
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:53,253
equals _roast, all right, so we're in good shape there.

311
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:55,032
The next thing we need to do now,

312
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,094
is to check both the _cream and the _sweetener.

313
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,999
If the...

314
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:05,842
If the _cream, for example,

315
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:08,613
is not equal to "None" ...

316
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,113
and ...

317
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,814
It's not String.IsNullOrEmpty

318
00:18:18,815 --> 00:18:23,020
_cream, so we have something in _cream.

319
00:18:23,021 --> 00:18:27,397
Then we'll add it into the ResultTextBlock.Text.

320
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,980
We'll use plus equal, because we want to make sure to

321
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:33,120
add on whatever the _roast was.

322
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,522
We're going to add a plus symbol and some spacing.

323
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:40,389
And then we're also going to add _cream.

324
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,848
Whatever's in that _cream variable, okay.

325
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,817
And then I need to do the same thing.

326
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:51,256
With _sweetener, so let me just replace all those.

327
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:05,951
All right, and I'm going to go ahead and build it.

328
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:16,346
All right, so let's just test some weird scenarios here.

329
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,056
All right, that makes sense.

330
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,569
All right, none.

331
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,456
None.

332
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,776
Dark.

333
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:33,694
Whole milk.

334
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:35,178
None.

335
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,656
Dark, okay, I feel good about this.

336
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:39,620
I think we've completed that step.

337
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:41,028
So let's continue in the next video.

338
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,793
See you there, thanks.
