00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,659
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.LearnVisualStudio.net</v>      

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,319
and this is the first of several solution videos for      

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,169
the challenge I call the Adeptly Adaptive Challenge, whew.      

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,649
Alright, so let's go ahead and get started by creating      

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,249
a New Project.      

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,149
I'm also going to turn off the webcam here so      

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,719
we can focus on just the screen.      

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,289
And I'm going to call this FakeNews.      

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,740
You can call it whatever you'd like to.      

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,369
And so in this first video all we're going to do      

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,940
is setup the Project and get the MainPage.xaml laid out.      

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,049
And the first thing I want to do is open up the Assets      

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,149
from the previous lesson.      

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,689
I'm going to copy the Food and Financial PNGs      

15
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,289
into the Assets folder.      

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,689
So I'm just going to drag and drop them into Assets, great.      

17
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,849
And while I'm here in the Solution Explorer,      

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,470
I'm actually going to open up the Instructions.txt      

19
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,670
and I will keep those around and available.      

20
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,789
And let me pull this back out here.      

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,719
Also, since we're opened up in the App.xaml.cs      

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,540
I'm going to remove the frame counter.      

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,300
And then we'll open up the      

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,719
MainPage.xaml.      

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,819
And I know that I'm going to create two areas,      

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,400
a top area that will contain      

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,549
the SearchBox      

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,219
and the Title of the current Page that we're on      

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,889
and then in the second Row of the Grid      

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,789
we're going to add a SplitView with a pane      

31
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,879
and a content area.      

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,589
The content area will then contain a GridView      

33
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,319
ultimately with all of our news items.      

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,889
Okay, so let's go      

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,860
Grid.RowDefinitions.      

36
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,840
And we'll set this one Auto.      

37
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,900
And the second one will be just "*" sizing.      

38
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,989
So in the top Row, what we'll do is just add      

39
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,570
actually a RelativePanel.      

40
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,919
And I'm going to create first of all a Button      

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
that will be used for      

42
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,869
our HamburgerButton,      

43
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,140
the TextBlock which will be used for the      

44
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,649
title, that bold title,      

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,749
and then I'm going to use an AutoSuggestBox      

46
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,749
for the search.      

47
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,419
Now we're not going to implement search      

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,770
but I'm just going to use that and set it up here.      

49
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,719
So the Button, we're going to set that to the      

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,389
RelativePanel.RightOf      

51
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,650
RelativePanel.AlignLeftWithPanel,      

52
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,000
True.      

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,049
And while I'm here I should probably go ahead      

54
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,619
and just flush everything out here.      

55
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,440
This is going to be HamburgerButton.      

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,409
And let's go ahead and we know that we're      

57
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,289
going to use the FontFamily of      

58
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,500
Segoe MDL2 Assets      

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,840
Segoe MDL2 Assets.      

60
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,009
And if we take a look      

61
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,970
in our little help file here,      

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,800
I know that we're going to use      

63
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,060
that character.      

64
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,700
And let's set the FontSize="20".      

65
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,019
And I think we'll just go ahead and set      

66
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,849
the Width and the Height="45".      

67
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,740
That should be sufficiently large.      

68
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,949
And I'm going to set the alignment of this item      

69
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,619
to the Center,      

70
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,449
and I'm also going to go ahead and create a      

71
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,549
Click event for this guy.      

72
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,619
We'll come back to that, great.      

73
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,649
All right, so now the TextBlock will be      

74
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,850
RelativePanel.RightOf="HamburgerButton", great.      

75
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,019
And I'm going to set the FontSize="18".      

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,500
The FontWeight will be Bold.      

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,589
I'm going to go ahead and give it a name as well      

78
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,270
because we're going to need that.      

79
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,689
So TitleTextBlock.      

80
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,700
We're going to set it programmatically, right?      

81
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,279
I think the only thing we'll need to do is probably give it      

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,389
some Margin so I want it like 20 pixels from the left,      

83
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,049
and I know I'm going to probably want to set      

84
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,900
some of it on the right as well,      

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,809
or at least on the top.      

86
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,270
Alright, the next stop, let's go to the AutoSuggestBox      

87
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,689
and give this just the Name      

88
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,519
"MyAutoSuggestBox".      

89
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,019
I probably should give it a different name than that      

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,969
but I'm lazy right now.      

91
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,619
And we're going to set the QueryIcon="Find",      

92
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,170
give us a little magnifying glass.      

93
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,270
And then the PlaceholderText, we'll type in Search.      

94
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,989
Now if you'd like to do this, I would recommend that you      

95
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,250
go off and you build this functionality.      

96
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,289
You should have the tools already to do that sort of thing.      

97
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,770
So I want this aligned on the right-hand side      

98
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,969
and I'll set the Width="200"      

99
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,319
and I know we're going to need some Margin as well      

100
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,649
so I'll just go ahead and take a stab at it.      

101
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,349
A "0" on the left.      

102
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,449
I know I'm going to need some on the top.      

103
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,719
I'll come back to that one.      

104
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,620
Let's just say "10" from the right, and "0".      

105
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,779
That should do it.      

106
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,700
Okay, so that's in the top row.      

107
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,489
The next Row, that's SplitView,      

108
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,300
and we'll set the Grid.Row="1".      

109
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,909
And I'm going to go ahead and give it a name as well      

110
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,949
because I know we're going to want to      

111
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,119
control it programmatically from the      

112
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,489
HamburgerButton, right.      

113
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,649
So MySplitView.      

114
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,449
And I'm going to set the      

115
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,420
DisplayMode="CompactOverlay".      

116
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,150
Whoops.      

117
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,900
Go ahead and do that.      

118
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,989
And I'm going to go ahead and do this      

119
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,400
while I'm thinking about it.      

120
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,800
SplitView.Content, great.      

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,889
I'll come back here and finish this idea up.      

122
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,189
I know I'm going to need the OpenPaneLength.      

123
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,789
I'm going to set it to like 150 to start      

124
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,319
and see if that works well.      

125
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,219
And then I'm going to set the      

126
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,082
CompactPaneLength="45".      

127
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,050
I'm setting it to the same Width as my      

128
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,070
HamburgerButton.      

129
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,219
Okay, now we have a SplitView      

130
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,589
and inside that we're going to add the ListBox      

131
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,340
like I've been working with here.      

132
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,349
And I'm going set the      

133
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,470
SelectionMode="Single"      

134
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,449
and I'm going to set the      

135
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:25,169
SelectionChanged equal to a NewEventHandler.      

136
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,640
That should be good.      

137
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,589
Okay, good.      

138
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,289
Inside of here, I'm going to need a few ListBox      

139
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,470
or at least two ListBoxItems.      

140
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,389
So the first one, I'm going to create a StackPanel.      

141
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,149
And we've done this so many times already,      

142
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,589
hopefully this isn't foreign to you.      

143
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,389
So the Orientation="Horizontal"      

144
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,640
and we'll use two TextBlocks, right.      

145
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,119
The first one will be that Segoe MDL2 Assets      

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,740
so FontFamily.      

147
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,140
And I think I'm using FontSize="20" for those assets.      

148
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,389
And I think, if memory serves me correctly,      

149
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,949
I put that in here as well,      

150
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,700
and yeah, we'll use that as the Home.      

151
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,770
So we'll set the Text.      

152
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,000
Go with that.      

153
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,600
And the second one, TextBlock, will just have the Text.      

154
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,979
Financial.      

155
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,049
This is the Font, actually      

156
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,500
FontSize="18".      

157
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,809
And I know that needs some Margin on the left,      

158
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,040
so I'll go ahead and just use 20 there.      

159
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,030
I'm also going to name this, the first item,      

160
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,070
Financial.      

161
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:20,089
And so that should pretty much wrap up      

162
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,759
that first ListBoxItem.      

163
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,649
Tell you what I'm going to do.      

164
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,170
I'm just going to copy the whole thing      

165
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,229
and actually let me copy the whole thing ListBoxItem.      

166
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,019
There we go.      

167
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,430
And I'll replace this one.      

168
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,900
I'm just going to replace this with Food.      

169
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,449
And this will be Food      

170
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,100
and then the icon should be the Star, I believe.      

171
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,999
Great.      

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,489
Alright, that should take care of that.      

173
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,500
Now inside of the Content area,      

174
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,170
I know I'm going to have a GridView.      

175
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,789
Just trying to figure out what needs to happen      

176
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,040
inside of there.      

177
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,949
Let me just try a GridView by itself      

178
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,499
and see where that takes us.      

179
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,889
I may have to come back and revisit this      

180
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,200
but we'll start here.      

181
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,519
I'm going to give this the Name      

182
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,389
NewsItemGrid and I'll set the      

183
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,789
HorizontalAlignment="Stretch".      

184
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,349
That should take up the entire Width      

185
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,570
of the available area.      

186
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,349
Margin, I'm going to give me a little Margin      

187
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,140
on the left-hand side.      

188
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,669
And I know I'm going to need      

189
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,469
an Item.Source Property      

190
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,519
and I'm also going to need to do things like the      

191
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,440
GridView.ItemTemplate.      

192
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,349
And I had to do like a DataTemplate.      

193
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,300
We'll come back to that in an upcoming lesson.      

194
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:06,649
So I'll just get kind of set up for now.      

195
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,600
Let me see what this looks like to see if it started here.      

196
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,319
Again, I want to emphasize that in these videos      

197
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,289
I blow through writing this code because I've already done      

198
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,809
it once, it's fresh in my mind, and I have some notes      

199
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,950
as well to help.      

200
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,389
If this were a real application development effort,      

201
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,300
I would probably take my time.      

202
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,249
Okay, you can't see anything because we haven't wired up      

203
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,799
that button yet.      

204
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,789
I'll tell you what, let me go ahead      

205
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,849
and get that part working      

206
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,949
So I'm going go into the code behind for the      

207
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,700
MainPage.xaml here.      

208
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,910
And in the HamburgerButton_Click event,      

209
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,700
we'll go      

210
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,069
MySplitView.IsPaneOpen != MySplitView.IsPaneOpen      

211
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,519
MySplitView.IsPaneOpen != MySplitView.IsPaneOpen      

212
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:07,059
MySplitView.IsPaneOpen != MySplitView.IsPaneOpen      

213
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,289
Alright, let's go ahead and run it now.      

214
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,240
Whoops. What don't you like?      

215
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,870
Oh, sorry. (laughs)      

216
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,019
That's what it should be.      

217
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,300
Sorry about that.      

218
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,589
Alright, there you go.      

219
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,449
Alright, so we're off to a good start.      

220
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,219
Next up, we're going to work I think      

221
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,049
on the data, I forget.      

222
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,549
I'll look at my notes.      

223
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,089
But that should at least complete the first setup steps      

224
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,289
and the general layout.      

225
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,049
Okay, so let's pick it up in the next lesson.      

226
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,300
Thanks.
