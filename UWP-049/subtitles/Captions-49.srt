1
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,230
<v ->So we've kind of finished with the first half</v>      

2
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:08,168
of the series.      

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:11,000
Now we're going to move on and we're going to change the format up      

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,132
just a little bit.      

5
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:14,616
Up to this point we would cover some topics      

6
00:00:14,617 --> 00:00:16,280
that were loosely related,      

7
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,146
then we would have a cheat sheet session,      

8
00:00:18,147 --> 00:00:19,586
then I would assign a challenge,      

9
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,125
in order to reinforce those ideas.      

10
00:00:22,126 --> 00:00:24,482
Now we're going to kind of move past that,      

11
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,554
move on to a new format where we're going to build      

12
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:31,372
four entire applications from scratch.      

13
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:34,785
So a lot of times the developers that I've spoken to      

14
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:38,892
through the years, they understand C#      

15
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:43,254
they understand Object-Oriented Programming.      

16
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:46,464
But they don't understand how to decompose something      

17
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:49,398
in their head and make a full application out of it.      

18
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,768
So hopefully this process will illustrate how to do that.      

19
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:56,501
Secondly we're going to move into other areas      

20
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:58,858
of the Universal Windows Platform      

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,672
that we haven't talked about yet.      

22
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:02,250
Learn some new techniques,      

23
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:05,204
some new features of Visual Studio.      

24
00:01:05,205 --> 00:01:09,428
So there'll be a lot to learn taking this other tact      

25
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:11,583
as we approach this material.      

26
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:15,252
So feel free to follow along, that would be great.      

27
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,310
I'm going to move fast, I'll warn you right up front.      

28
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,078
Make sure that you reference the snapshots      

29
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,275
for each video.      

30
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,143
So at the end of each video I'd copy off      

31
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:28,563
the current state of the code into its own .zip file.      

32
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:31,262
So make sure you download that .zip file      

33
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:34,600
and you take a look at the code that I typed in there.      

34
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:38,258
Or you're going to be pausing or rewinding a lot,      

35
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,314
which is fine too.      

36
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:42,397
But you might find more satisfaction at looking at      

37
00:01:42,398 --> 00:01:44,391
that actual code that I typed in.      

38
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:46,161
So what are we going to learn?      

39
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,071
Well let's go ahead and run the application      

40
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:50,866
and first of all I wanted to point out that you see that      

41
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,337
red splash screen.      

42
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:53,805
We'll talk about that.      

43
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,778
How we were able to achieve that      

44
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:59,863
by modifying the Package.appxmanifest file.      

45
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:02,508
And that will be near the end of our development effort      

46
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,897
on this application.      

47
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:08,737
But we can add resources that'll be utilized in the store,      

48
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:13,643
on the start bar, and the splash page, things like that.      

49
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:14,977
Alright so you can see that I had      

50
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:17,238
this simple soundboard application.      

51
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,097
The idea here is that there is an icon for each sound.      

52
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,910
I've only included a handful of sounds.      

53
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:25,728
Feel free to flush this out, add as many sounds      

54
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,245
and more functionality if you want.      

55
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:31,392
But the idea here is that you can find a category      

56
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:35,093
of sounds using the hamburger navigation.      

57
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:38,794
And then we find one that you want to play,      

58
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:40,191
you just tap on it,(sound effect)      

59
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:42,079
click on it and it will play that sound.      

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,823
Okay so clearly hamburger navigation,      

61
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,340
using the back buttons, State Management,      

62
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:51,999
looking at the AutoSuggestBox we are able      

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,474
to find one specific sound,      

64
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,288
play that,(cow mooing)      

65
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,986
and then clear out that sound and have      

66
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:05,316
the state of the application return back to normal.      

67
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:09,316
There's also clearly we're using media here      

68
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,610
we're using sound so we're going to demonstrate      

69
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:12,836
the use of the Media element,      

70
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:14,660
which allows you to play video and sounds      

71
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:19,661
and various functionality around that new User Control.      

72
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,131
We're also going to demonstrate drag-and-drop      

73
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,339
so here's a .mp3 file that i have on my desktop      

74
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,773
and I was going to drag it and drop it.      

75
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,544
Alright and this is a little song      

76
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,368
that was played by a friend.      

77
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:36,748
It's actually kinda long so,(sound effect)      

78
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,013
if you play another sound it will cancel that one out.      

79
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:43,798
That was purely accidental but a cool feature none the less.      

80
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,826
Okay we've already talking about      

81
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:46,743
the Package.appxmanifest.      

82
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,002
And then finally what we're going to do      

83
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:50,412
after we build this application,      

84
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,820
is we're going to submit it to the store,      

85
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,548
walk through that entire process      

86
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,177
and then just to kind of restate this,      

87
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:00,737
I've already built this application.      

88
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:03,115
I'm coming back to record this video      

89
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:04,438
after I've finished.      

90
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,144
And at the very end,      

91
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,502
I left you with a cliffhanger.      

92
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:11,605
You know, is this actually going to pass?      

93
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:14,069
Am I going to be able to get this thing into the Window Store?      

94
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,070
And so just this morning I got this notification      

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,965
that your submission for UWP SoundBoard passed certification      

96
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:24,736
Alright, so it's in the store      

97
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,559
it will be published within 24 hours.      

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,742
Alright so that's pretty cool.      

99
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:29,482
So it actually worked.      

100
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:31,434
So the cliffhanger I leave you at the end      

101
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:32,692
of the last video with,      

102
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:35,295
I've already, it's going to be anti-climactic      

103
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:37,588
because you already know that it will pass.      

104
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:39,401
And I didn't do anything off-camera.      

105
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:42,185
Everything you saw was what I did here on camera.      

106
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:44,702
Alright so hopefully this will be      

107
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,590
a great learning exercise for you.      

108
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:50,067
Again, different format, so don't let that throw you.      

109
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:53,970
Please follow along, if not by writing code      

110
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,976
at least stay engaged as I write it.      

111
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:57,481
It'll be a little bit dryer      

112
00:04:57,482 --> 00:04:59,752
because I'll be talking to myself a lot      

113
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:01,000
instead of talking to you.      

114
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,794
But hopefully you'll get some value out of it.      

115
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,895
Okay, let's start up in the next lesson.      

116
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:06,994
Thanks.
