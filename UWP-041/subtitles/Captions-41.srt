00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:09,445
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net,</v>      

2
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:11,124
and in this lesson we're going to talk about      

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,585
keeping your DataBoundControls updated      

4
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:16,844
whenever the underlying collection      

5
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:20,201
of poco objects changes out from under you.      

6
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:22,321
So previously, up to this point,      

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,081
whenever we were binding to data,      

8
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:25,616
the only scenario I showed you      

9
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:30,616
was binding to kind of a static set of items.      

10
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,844
And so we would bind once whenever the Page      

11
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:36,204
first loads or whenever the App first loads.      

12
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:39,185
However, we need to discuss another scenario,      

13
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:42,904
and that's in what happens whenever we update      

14
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:46,684
that collection of data out from under      

15
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:49,484
our DataBoundControls.      

16
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:52,123
So what happens when I need to programmatically      

17
00:00:52,124 --> 00:00:54,386
add new items to the List      

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,905
or remove items from the list?      

19
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:59,364
Well I want you to take a look at this example.      

20
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:02,284
It's the simplest possible contact manager      

21
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:03,984
application you can build.      

22
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:06,524
Here I'm just going to add my first name, my last name,      

23
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,284
and then choose an avatar from a list and click Add.      

24
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:12,384
Now my intent here is to create a new instance      

25
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:15,605
of Contact, add it to a collection,      

26
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:18,725
a list of Contact called Contacts,      

27
00:01:18,726 --> 00:01:22,244
and then I'm hoping that my GridView control      

28
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:25,264
in that large white area below my form      

29
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:28,407
will actually then display the new contact.      

30
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:29,947
But as you can see, it doesn't do that,      

31
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,747
and I'm left to scratch my head here      

32
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,187
and wonder why isn't that working?      

33
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:35,667
Well the reason why that's not working      

34
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:38,007
is because nobody told the GridView      

35
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,047
that something changed.      

36
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:44,008
You have to let it know that there      

37
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,248
is new information to bind to.      

38
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,727
The way you do that is to use      

39
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:50,807
a different type of collection.      

40
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:52,447
So here you can see that I've created      

41
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:55,347
a collection, a List<Contact>.      

42
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,607
And we've done that up to this point,      

43
00:01:57,608 --> 00:02:00,307
but it's not going to work for us anymore.      

44
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:02,947
What we need to use is a different type of collection      

45
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:06,067
called ObservableCollection<Contact>.      

46
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:08,914
Alright, so let me comment out some things      

47
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,643
and un-comment out some things.      

48
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,603
So now you can see that I've changed      

49
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:14,921
from my List<Contact> to an ObservableCollection<Contact>      

50
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:16,019
ObservableCollection<Contact>.      

51
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,019
So whenever you see the term "Observable"      

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,339
in the .NET Framework Class Library,      

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,280
that means that your DataBoundControl,      

54
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,540
whether it's a GridView, ListView,      

55
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,741
whatever the case might be,      

56
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:28,720
will be listening or watching      

57
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:31,040
the collection for changes.      

58
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,600
Whenever a change happens,      

59
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:35,580
the collection, the ObservableCollection<Contact>,      

60
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:38,720
will say, "Hey, anybody who's watching me right now,      

61
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:41,160
I have a change so you might want to go      

62
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,400
off and re-bind yourself to me." Alright.      

63
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,240
And so let's take a look now.      

64
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:49,160
Let's build the application, and uh-oh,      

65
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,820
we get an error.      

66
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:54,221
Why do we get an error that we cannot convert      

67
00:02:54,222 --> 00:02:57,320
from ObservableCollection<Contact>      

68
00:02:57,321 --> 00:03:02,321
to a List<Contact>?      

69
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,620
Well the reason is because of the way      

70
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:09,060
that we're binding to our data.      

71
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:11,160
You can see that we're using x:Bind statements.      

72
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:13,200
I didn't really say much about x:Bind      

73
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,060
when we actually started using it.      

74
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,460
It's actually the newest binding statement      

75
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,300
that's available.      

76
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,400
It was just introduced with the Universal      

77
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,540
Windows Platform, and what it does is it      

78
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,180
pre-compiles the bindings before      

79
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,640
your application runs even the first time,      

80
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,681
whereas in the old style just the binding syntax      

81
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:33,120
that was available previously before the Universal      

82
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:35,760
Windows Platform, it would do this all at runtime.      

83
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,572
Now why would you pre-compile?      

84
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:40,112
You pre-compile to improve the performance      

85
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:41,730
of the application.      

86
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:44,230
So what's happening here is when I first wrote      

87
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:47,590
this application against a List<Contact>,      

88
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,530
Visual Studio went out and generated      

89
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:51,509
some source code for me behind the scenes      

90
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,390
that I can't easily get to from the Solution Explorer.      

91
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,568
I can get to it, it's just not easy to get to.      

92
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:01,527
Now the way to fix this is to tell Visual Studio,      

93
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:04,268
"Hey, go off and re-generate that code."      

94
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,528
And the way you do that is you go      

95
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,928
inside of your data template      

96
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:09,608
and you just hit, you select everything      

97
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,628
inside the data template, you hit Control+X,      

98
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,088
you give Visual Studio half a second to think      

99
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,108
about it, and then you go Control+V      

100
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:18,609
to paste it back in.      

101
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,649
When you do that, it should now re-generate      

102
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,308
what we're binding to.      

103
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:25,448
In this case, we're going to bind      

104
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,248
to an ObservableCollection instead of a List Collection.      

105
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,589
That code should be generated now      

106
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,959
when I go to build the solution again.      

107
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,943
Bam, it works.      

108
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,451
Okay, so let's go ahead and run the application now      

109
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:36,771
and see the app actually working this time      

110
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:39,830
as I type in my name and I choose an avatar.      

111
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,630
And there you go.      

112
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:45,209
Our ObservableCollection<Contact> said, "Hey,      

113
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,509
I've got a new contact,      

114
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,849
Bob Tabor with the bearded guy icon.      

115
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,729
So if you're binding to me,      

116
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,089
anybody who's binding to me,      

117
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,689
you need to know that I've changed."      

118
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,489
And so the grid view says, "Hmmm,      

119
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,709
well yeah, I was watching you and I see      

120
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,689
that you changed, let me go ahead      

121
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,029
and update what I'm displaying on-screen here."      

122
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,210
And so there you go.      

123
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:08,229
If you like anthropomorphic explanations of code,      

124
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,549
then hey, this was right in your wheel house.      

125
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,529
Okay, so one last thing that I want to say      

126
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,685
before we move on off this topic,      

127
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:17,946
and that is whenever you're reading articles      

128
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:19,626
online or watching videos, you might come      

129
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:23,446
across a term called MVVM related to binding      

130
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,845
to data with your Universal Windows Platform app,      

131
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:30,385
your Windows 8.1, or Windows Phone 8.1 app,      

132
00:05:30,386 --> 00:05:33,946
or even the Windows Presentation Foundation app,      

133
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:38,947
all of these XAML-based platforms.      

134
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:44,035
So MVVM stands for Model View View Model.      

135
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:47,475
It is a designed pattern for writing code      

136
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,876
on the user interface that binds to data.      

137
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:52,436
Now what I'm showing you in this example      

138
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,376
with the ObservableCollection is really      

139
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:58,635
a building block, a first step foundational concept      

140
00:05:58,636 --> 00:06:01,295
towards learning more about MVVM,      

141
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,795
and I actually cover that topic in depth      

142
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,796
in the previous version of this series,      

143
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:08,376
the Windows Phone 8.1 Development      

144
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,776
for Absolute Beginners series on channel 9.      

145
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:12,676
So if you want to learn more about MVVM,      

146
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:16,295
you'll want to take a look at all of those lessons      

147
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:19,415
that have something to do with ObservableCollection,      

148
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:22,727
or MVVM, or this interface called      

149
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,467
I Notify Property Changed.      

150
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,287
Okay, look in the descriptions for the videos      

151
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,588
or the titles to see that.      

152
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:34,027
And like I said, this apply that MVVM concept applies      

153
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:37,887
to all XAML-based user interface technologies.      

154
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:40,127
Okay, so that's all that I want to say about that,      

155
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:43,207
but we're going to revisit our little simple      

156
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,008
contact manager application in the next couple      

157
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,487
of lessons, so we will see you there.      

158
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:50,735
Thanks.
