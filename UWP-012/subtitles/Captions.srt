00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,979
<v ->Hi I'm Bob Tabor with www.LearnVisualStudio.NET</v>

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,959
and this is the solution for the challenge

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,359
that I call the Laudable Layout Challenge.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,799
Now, let's stop right here before we get too far.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,149
If you're watching this immediately

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,109
after watching the challenge video, the previous video

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,989
if you've not cracked open Visual Studio

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,779
and written a single line of code yet

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,419
then stop what you're doing.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,689
Shame on you!

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,139
Open up Visual Studio, do this for yourself.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,719
Nobody learns by just watching videos.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,519
I mean nobody learns by just watching videos

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,789
they also have to get their hands dirty in the code.

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,019
That's how you learn.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,069
So, stop the video right now.

17
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,249
Don't watch another second of this.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,909
Go off and do the challenge.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,549
If you get stuck, come back here

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,459
and watch just enough of this to get unstuck.

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,529
All right, we cool?

22
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,719
Let's get started.

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,979
So let's create a new project.

24
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,259
I'm going to call this "laudable".

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,259
And I spelled that incorrectly once

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,329
and had to redo this video, so I learned

27
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,528
how to spell "laudable", if nothing else.

28
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:09,019
LaudableLayout.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,349
All right, and let's bring up the image

30
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,039
that we're trying to recreate here, all right.

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,679
So it looks like we have one, two, three, four, five rows

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,789
plus a row at the very bottom, which I'm going to add

33
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,279
that will just kind of

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,769
I'll use star sizing to take up all the available space.

35
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,399
That'll make sure everfything else gets pushed up

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,859
and it only takes as much as it needs.

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,459
Then it looks like there's one, two, three columns

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,419
and on my screen as I'm looking at it here

39
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,919
it looks like about an inch for

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,519
this last column here on the right.

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,159
This looks like maybe two inches here on the left-hand side

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,959
and in the center it looks like three inches.

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,619
So, this would be a great two star, three star

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,819
one star layout, as far as the columns are concerned.

45
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,159
It looks like the rows will just be auto for the most part

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,359
so this should be pretty easy.

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,349
Let's go and minimize that and bring Visual Studio back up.

48
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,499
And we're only going to be working with the layouts.

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,829
Let me open MainPage.xaml and move this over

50
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,639
so we get a good look at this.

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,269
And I'm going to do most of the work just here

52
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,039
from memory, in the XAML pane and not really worry

53
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,789
about what the designer looks like too much

54
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,159
we'll come back to that later.

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,529
So, first thing I'm going to do is lay out

56
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,089
some rows and columns, so here we go.

57
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,659
Grid.RowDefinition

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,419
and then below it Grid.ColumnDefinitions.

59
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,199
And so the RowDefinition

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,329
will have a height of "auto"

61
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,690
in almost all cases, and we need five of those.

62
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:51,779
Two, three, four, five.

63
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,349
And the sixth one, I'm going to set that to star sizing.

64
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,259
Okay?

65
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,399
Let's do the same thing for column definitions.

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,019
So we're going to create a column definition

67
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,579
and we're going to set it's width equal to...

68
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,139
I'll come back and fill that in in a moment.

69
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,419
The first one will be one star.

70
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,719
The second one, whoops, sorry, will be two stars.

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,089
The second one will be three stars

72
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,899
and the last one will be one star.

73
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,829
Great.

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,069
All right, so next up I know that I'm going to need

75
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,209
one, two, three, four text blocks.

76
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,719
So let's go ahead and TextBlock

77
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,356
and I know I'm going to set it in a row

78
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:35,959
and I don't think I need to change the column at all

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,479
in these, so we'll just leave that like that.

80
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,667
One, two, three, four.

81
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:46,659
This will be row zero, row one

82
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,059
row two, row three.

83
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,409
I don't even need to use this

84
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,819
so I'm just going to delete it.

85
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,729
Let's see.

86
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,439
And then I'm going to need text boxes.

87
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,629
So TextBox.

88
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,149
Grid.Row equals

89
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,759
and then Grid.Column equals

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,699
one, the second column.

91
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,409
Let's copy that a bunch of times.

92
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,881
And paste it.

93
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,849
Great.

94
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,739
Then this will be row one.

95
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,209
It'll just match whatever the row is

96
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,789
of the text block above it.

97
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,629
And then finally, let's go and add a button

98
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,409
and this will be in Grid.Row four

99
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,800
and Grid.Column one.

100
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:37,689
Okay.

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,369
Now, let's come up here and set

102
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,209
the Text property for each of these.

103
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,499
So this is "First Name".

104
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,269
This is "Last Name".

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,389
And this one's "Email".

106
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,239
Whoops.

107
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,229
Okay and then the Button's Content property

108
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,819
is going to be equal to "Save", all right.

109
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,089
Now let's worry about this top TextBlock.

110
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,499
We want its text equal to

111
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,359
"ACME Sales Corp", all right.

112
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,849
And I know that the font size is going to be 48.

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,749
Now, this was the tricky part.

114
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,539
If you found this, good for you.

115
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,359
Grid.ColumnSpan equals three.

116
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,569
So that should make it span and you can see barely here

117
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,549
in the little sliver of our design window

118
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,059
that we get the desired effect.

119
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,589
Okay, let me actually blow the design window up

120
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,809
so we can take a closer look at what we've done so far

121
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,659
because we're getting close to the end here.

122
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,479
Okay, we have some margin issues.

123
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,999
We need more spacing on the left.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,539
We need spacing between each of the rows.

125
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,699
Otherwise we're in good shape.

126
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,449
So, let me get back here, and the first

127
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,499
thing I'm going to do is just create a margin

128
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,949
from the left for the entire grid.

129
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,299
So, we'll go 10 pixels from the left and then zeroes.

130
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,375
That should move everything over from the left.

131
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:13,029
Next up, we're going to want to create space

132
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,999
between each of the text boxes

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,169
to give them a little breathing room.

134
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,939
So, margin, zero, zero

135
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,583
zero, 10.

136
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:23,669
And that should do it.

137
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,619
And I'll put 10 pixels of space

138
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,099
beneath each of the text boxes

139
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,099
thus stretching out the height of each row.

140
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,209
And I think the last thing that we needed to do

141
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,099
was to ensure that the text block

142
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,279
in each of the rows is centered.

143
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,009
We can see right now it's aligned

144
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,668
to the top and left side of that cell.

145
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,089
And so this is the last thing we'll need to do.

146
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,089
We'll go VerticalAlignment equals center.

147
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,388
Let's copy that and put that in each of the text blocks.

148
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:07,709
And I think we're done with this.

149
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,589
Let's go ahead and save this and run the application.

150
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,379
All righty.

151
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,299
And there you go, we've got it.

152
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,289
Now, I do see one little annoying thing

153
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,149
that we never talked about.

154
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,559
Whenever you create a new project

155
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,479
you automatically get a frame counter.

156
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,199
That's great, whenever you're debugging

157
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,939
certain types of applications.

158
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,069
We won't need it in this series

159
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,519
so I'm going to get rid of that

160
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,908
and the way you do that is you go to the App.xaml

161
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,209
you go to the code behind App.xaml.cs

162
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,149
and you go down to line number 34, oh I'm sorry, 43.

163
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,609
Had that transposed.

164
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,609
And let's go ahead and delete lines 43 through 48 like so.

165
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,379
And now when we run the app

166
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,539
the frame counter will no longer be there.

167
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,639
Awesome.

168
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,249
Oops, I see one omission here.

169
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,219
There needs to be more space between

170
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,759
this text block and the first row.

171
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,539
So one last thing we'll need to do here.

172
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,879
Let's go up to the TextBlock and let's go ahead

173
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,059
and add a margin there as well.

174
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,379
Margin equals zero, zero, zero, 20.

175
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,439
That should put sufficient space below it.

176
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,269
And there we have it, great.

177
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,219
All right, hopefully you got this.

178
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,439
You know, if this is something you struggled with

179
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,589
then maybe you should come back tomorrow and try it again.

180
