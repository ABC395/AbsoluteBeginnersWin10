1
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:08,608
<v ->In this lesson, we're going to learn a little bit more</v>

2
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,548
about how to use some of the features of the

3
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:15,927
phone emulator in order to uncover a

4
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:19,218
issue with our short-term memory. (laughs)

5
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:22,665
The programmer's short-term memory, not the device.

6
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:26,025
And so, let's go ahead and if you haven't already done this,

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,245
change from running it on the local machine to one of

8
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:33,835
the mobile emulators and I'm going to go ahead and hit run.

9
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:37,935
And then I'll show you one of the

10
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:42,935
cool features of the emulator that I briefly touched on

11
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:46,074
at the very outset of this series of lessons,

12
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:49,314
but didn't really elaborate on at the time.

13
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:54,254
So what we want to do is test our app to see if it's grabbing

14
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,954
coordinates correctly, geo coordinates,

15
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,314
from different places in the world,

16
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:01,734
and so one of the things that we can do is actually

17
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:04,556
click the double chevron to open up the Tools pane

18
00:01:04,557 --> 00:01:07,716
for the emulator and go to the location tab.

19
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:11,565
And here what I can do is search on a map,

20
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:14,305
you know, either search for cities or places

21
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:21,005
or I can zoom in, zoom out, and find somewhere on the map

22
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:25,654
and say, I am physically located here.

23
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:28,294
Now I'm sitting in Dallas, but I'm putting my little marker

24
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:32,074
there in Redmond, and now that will tell the emulator

25
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:36,914
whenever it uses the location services for the emulator,

26
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:41,554
or for the phone, serve up Redmond,

27
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:44,254
the location that I have pinned right there.

28
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:46,453
So let's go ahead and click the get weather button,

29
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:48,173
and it gives us that familiar little

30
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:54,133
little message, "Are you sure you want to allow

31
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:57,113
"this application to access location?"

32
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:58,614
I'm going to go ahead and click yes.

33
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:02,453
Now, when I do this, we're going to,

34
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:05,514
you know, be a little confused here.

35
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:09,893
I have my position set to Redmond, however,

36
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:12,373
this is still delivering back Dallas County.

37
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:15,813
Now I could say to myself, "Hmm, there must be a problem

38
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:18,914
"with what I've done here in the location

39
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:22,634
"window of the emulator or maybe I did

40
00:02:22,635 --> 00:02:24,314
"something incorrectly in code."

41
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:26,994
And in this case, the latter would be true,

42
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,333
but this would help us to uncover issues.

43
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:32,774
And the issue is this, if we take a look at this,

44
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:37,554
the OpenWeatherMapProxy.cs, you can see that we hardcoded

45
00:02:37,555 --> 00:02:39,493
the latitude and longitude and

46
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:42,333
we never ever swapped that out.

47
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:44,973
So what we should do here is actually

48
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,682
var url equals and then I'll do

49
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:55,682
a String.Format around that

50
00:02:55,754 --> 00:03:00,273
and then pass in the lat and longitude that we grabbed from

51
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,913
from input parameters for the GetWeather method.

52
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,792
Let me grab all of this out right here

53
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:11,361
and paste that in there and we will substitute in

54
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:17,902
latitude and longitude.

55
00:03:17,903 --> 00:03:22,502
So, it frequently, I see people go online and say,

56
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:26,541
"Hey, Microsoft's stuff is broken. It doesn't work."

57
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:31,381
And many times I've done that

58
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:33,001
and when I was just getting started,

59
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:34,881
I thought that they were the problem,

60
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,682
but the longer I do this, the more I realize

61
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:40,821
it's me that's the problem, that I've forgotten something.

62
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:45,810
And so, that humility has led to,

63
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:47,650
has prevented me from a lot

64
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,650
of embarrassing situations. (laughs)

65
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,090
Alright, so be humble when you're a software developer

66
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:53,850
because it's probably going to come back

67
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:55,150
and bite you at some point.

68
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,530
Okay, here we go.

69
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,410
Now that I've fixed that,

70
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:05,123
and let's open up the tools pane and location

71
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:09,922
and looks like it forgot my, where I was at previously here

72
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:13,143
so let's go ahead and make sure we put

73
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,542
our pin right on Redmond and then click get weather.

74
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:18,923
Allow permissions and here we go.

75
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:21,542
We get Redmond, it's 56 degrees and there's a light mist.

76
00:04:21,543 --> 00:04:22,303
Very nice.

77
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:28,203
Alright, so that's how we could use the emulator's tools

78
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,160
to further test our application

79
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:33,300
to uncover bugs that we may not find,

80
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:36,321
especially whenever there's a sensor

81
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:39,541
on the device that we're utilizing.

82
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,430
And there are other sensors that

83
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,827
we can mimic in a similar sort of way.

84
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:47,748
We're just not utilizing those in this series of lessons.

85
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:49,988
Alright, so let's continue on in the next lesson

86
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,668
as we continue to build this app.

87
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,368
See you there, thanks.
