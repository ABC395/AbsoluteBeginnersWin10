1
00:00:05,282 --> 00:00:07,372
<v ->Ok, so continuing on, in this lesson</v>      

2
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:10,966
we're going to layout the user interface for the game.      

3
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:13,334
We're going to set up the data binding.      

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:14,912
We've already collected a lot of data,      

5
00:00:14,913 --> 00:00:19,403
now it's time to connect it to a GridView,      

6
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:22,187
and the DataTemplate and each      

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,152
individual item and make it clickable,      

8
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:26,432
we'll come back to that part,      

9
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,037
and to basically do initial game setup.      

10
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,234
So, the game won't be playable by the end of this video,      

11
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:34,991
but will in really good shape to      

12
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:37,178
actually start the game logic like scoring      

13
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:40,826
and countdown in the next video.      

14
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:44,793
Alright, so let us get started now.      

15
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,927
Where I left of in the previous video,      

16
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:51,716
there was an issue, and it wouldn't compile,      

17
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:54,478
or it wouldn't run, I don't remember which.      

18
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,051
But the issue is easy, basically all I need to do is this,      

19
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:02,926
I didn't new up songs, so that's why it croaked.      

20
00:01:02,927 --> 00:01:05,880
If I add that and create a new instance of      

21
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,576
ObservableCollection now we should      

22
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,235
be able to run the application.      

23
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:12,610
While we won't see much behind the scenes,      

24
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:17,597
it should be going out and grabbing all of the files.      

25
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:28,056
and grabbing off all the metadata,      

26
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:30,360
and then creating new instances of the      

27
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:34,978
song class and making those available      

28
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,856
for the rest of our app, again,      

29
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:40,066
not a whole lot going on here unfortunately,      

30
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,493
but behind the scenes there's a lot happening.      

31
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:46,028
It's time to kind of rectify that,      

32
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:48,631
and to get started with this I'm going      

33
00:01:48,632 --> 00:01:51,394
to open up MainPage.xaml and we're      

34
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:53,303
going to start laying out the pieces      

35
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:55,847
that we need for this app.      

36
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:00,918
I'm going to start off by adding two rows,      

37
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:04,673
so there's going to be a first RowDefinition      

38
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:09,227
that will just be, i think it's just going      

39
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:11,131
to house the countdown bar.      

40
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,907
We'll make it 100, and the other RowDefinition      

41
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:21,908
will just be for the remainder of that space.      

42
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:26,506
Then we're going to add a StackPanel,      

43
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:29,055
this is just going to be that first row      

44
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:30,768
where we're going to add a ProgressBar.      

45
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:34,858
I'm going to go ahead and give it a name      

46
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,810
because we're gong to have to reference      

47
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,898
that programatically, so name equals....      

48
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,532
I'm going to set the maximum value to 100      

49
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:54,873
and the minimum value to 0.      

50
00:02:56,084 --> 00:03:00,377
I'm going to set the current value to 100      

51
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:03,278
we're going to use it as a countdown,      

52
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,206
so it'll always start at 100 and tick backwards.      

53
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:08,505
Also, I'm going to go ahead and      

54
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:11,384
set the height of this to 20 and      

55
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:13,587
the foreground equals blue.      

56
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:17,837
Again, I could really use some help      

57
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:20,232
from a graphic designer to make this look good.      

58
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:23,224
I'm also going to add in that top area      

59
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:28,173
the instruction TextBlock,      

60
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,911
so let me go ahead and give it that name,      

61
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:31,837
instruction TextBlock...      

62
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,997
This is going to tell the user what to do next.      

63
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,831
Hey, get ready because the next      

64
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:40,832
round is starting in ten, nine, eight sort of thing.      

65
00:03:42,914 --> 00:03:44,076
I'm going to set the foreground equal      

66
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:47,073
to blue again there, and the horizontal      

67
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:49,831
alignment I'll set to center.      

68
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,899
Then I'm going to go ahead and      

69
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,329
put the media element in here.      

70
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,419
It doesn't have visual quality but      

71
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,155
I'm going to go ahead and stick it there.      

72
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,862
I'm going to set the auto play equal to true.      

73
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,003
I changed this to capital "M" on MyProgressBar.      

74
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,732
I go back and forth on what to name      

75
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17,346
the XAML elements because I'm not sure      

76
00:04:17,347 --> 00:04:20,034
that they're public, I think they're more protected,      

77
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:22,690
so, it's really a judgement call      

78
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:25,053
on what naming convention to use there.      

79
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:29,325
So, that's going to be for Grid.Row equals zero.      

80
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,838
Let's put the second panel, StackPanel...      

81
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:39,649
and it's going to be Grid.Row equals one.      

82
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:45,127
I'm going to set the orientation of this vertical      

83
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:50,874
which I don't know that I need to do that,      

84
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,141
but I'm going to go ahead and do it anyway.      

85
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,164
Then, the majority of this is going to      

86
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,802
be a GridView control.      

87
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:03,449
Let's go ahead and give the GridView      

88
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,450
the name of song GridView,      

89
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:13,474
and I'm going to set the is item click enable equals true.      

90
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:18,003
I'm going to go ahead and handle an item click event,      

91
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:21,135
I'm also going to....      

92
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,078
set the ItemsSource.      

93
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,526
ItemsSource equal to...      

94
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:34,339
what we created in the previous video, the Songs collection.      

95
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,465
That should be visible      

96
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,681
to this MainPage.xaml.      

97
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:46,618
Did I make that private?... yeah, I made that private,      

98
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:48,234
it still should be visible here though      

99
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,719
because they're in the same class right?      

100
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:54,073
Let's add an ItemTemplate,      

101
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:57,620
GridView.ItemTemplate ...      

102
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,822
inside that ItemTemplate, we're going      

103
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:04,056
to add a DataTemplate,      

104
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,635
we're just going to just add a simple      

105
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:09,582
Grid with an Image control.      

106
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:16,707
I should probably call this AlbumArt.      

107
00:06:25,864 --> 00:06:28,391
I'm going to make the height 75      

108
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:30,226
and the width 75 because I happen      

109
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:33,842
to know that's the exact size of each of the      

110
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,796
images that are used in the metadata      

111
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,975
for the mp3's since I created them myself,      

112
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:42,871
or had a developer create them for me.      

113
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:48,374
I know that I'm going to bind to a      

114
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:53,620
property of songs called AlbumCover,      

115
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:57,403
let me double check that      

116
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:59,648
just to make sure that is in fact the name.      

117
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,746
Yeah, AlbumCover is the name of the      

118
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:05,227
property I want to bind to, so let me      

119
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:09,866
go ahead and do that... like so...      

120
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,506
That should pretty much do it      

121
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,909
for the GridView itself,      

122
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,114
we'll come back and obviously have a lot to do there.      

123
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:28,343
Then I need a few TextBlocks to display things,      

124
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:29,623
so there's going to be one called      

125
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:32,108
the result TextBlock, that'll tell you      

126
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:35,639
if you got the answer right or wrong.      

127
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,305
There will be another TextBlock      

128
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:41,462
called TitleTextBlock, this will show you      

129
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:45,804
what the correct song title was      

130
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:48,518
in case you missed it.      

131
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,516
There will be an ArtistTextBlock      

132
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:53,018
that will display the correct...      

133
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:57,384
artist.      

134
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:05,129
There will be a AlbumTextBlock      

135
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,521
to tell you the album that the song      

136
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,695
that was playing was performed on.      

137
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:13,613
Now, I know that I'm going to want      

138
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:15,403
another button in case you want to play again.      

139
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:19,669
So, I'm going to call this "Play Again" button,      

140
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,640
and the content will be play again.      

141
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,285
I'll make the background of this red      

142
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,800
and the horizontal alignment will      

143
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,885
just be in the center there.      

144
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:36,298
I'm going to set the visibility initially to collapsed      

145
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,524
because I don't want to see it until      

146
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,946
we get to that state where the game is over      

147
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:43,951
and I want to ask, "Hey, do you want to try it again?"      

148
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,377
At which point, then we'll allow that to happen.      

149
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:49,316
So let me also add a clicked event here,      

150
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,196
and that should take care of that      

151
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,769
and get rid of the button click,      

152
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:58,334
but I'm going to need somewhere to put      

153
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:01,096
all of that code in the button click.      

154
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:02,995
So, I think what I'll do is actually      

155
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:05,849
put that in a Page_Load event, so....      

156
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,165
Loaded equals page loaded and let's go there      

157
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,184
and look through all that code I cut,      

158
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:18,808
and I'm going to put it there.      

159
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:20,429
We can get rid of that.      

160
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:25,208
Then there's one last thing that I      

161
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,240
want to do here as well,      

162
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:31,565
I have two rows, the second row      

163
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:34,263
will obviously take up a majority of the space there.      

164
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:38,700
What I want to do is, we've already got      

165
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:43,197
a StackPanel inside that row one, so the second row,      

166
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:45,955
and I'm going to add another grid      

167
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:47,587
and I'm going to say that it's      

168
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,880
grid.row equal to one.      

169
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:54,344
so it's going to sit in that same row,      

170
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:58,562
cell actually, as the StackPanel that I just created.      

171
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:01,682
All this is actually going to have is a ProgressBar,      

172
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:04,423
actually, sorry, a ProgressRing.      

173
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:09,424
I'm going to call this start up ProgressRing.      

174
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,753
I'm going to set the horizontal      

175
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:15,004
alignment equals center, and the      

176
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,887
vertical alignment equals center.      

177
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:21,137
Let's set the width equal to something      

178
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:25,750
nice and big, like 200 and height equals 200, like that.      

179
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:30,118
Actually, that might be a little bit too big,      

180
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:33,563
let's put that back to that and then let's go      

181
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,996
foreground will say grey.      

182
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,190
I'm going to put all that on seperate      

183
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,897
lines so it's easier to read.      

184
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:45,272
The idea here is that since it's going to      

185
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:48,611
take some time to go through your      

186
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:52,077
entire music collection as you start up the app,      

187
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,792
I want to      

188
00:10:56,838 --> 00:10:59,396
display the ProgressRing      

189
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,618
and when it's finished with that operation,      

190
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,989
then I'll hide the ProgressRing.      

191
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,933
Alright, so that should do it for layout,      

192
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,396
basically, we may have to come and tweak a few things,      

193
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:12,711
margins and things of that nature,      

194
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:15,644
but I think we're pretty much in good shape to go      

195
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:20,556
so, what I want to do is...      

196
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,553
Let me see here, oh yeah...      

197
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,454
(mumbling)      

198
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,995
So when the page loads, we're going      

199
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,710
to do some of these things here,      

200
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:50,763
in fact, now that I think about it a little bit,      

201
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:53,925
I might want to take some of the stuff      

202
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:55,808
and put it into its own helper method.      

203
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:58,272
So, let's go private...      

204
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:00,196
and I'm guessing I'm going to have to      

205
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,796
make this async task      

206
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,957
called SetupMusicList.      

207
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,175
I'm going to go ahead and grab off...      

208
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:21,593
I think I'm just going to perform      

209
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:23,209
just these steps right here.      

210
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:28,809
Actually, I think I'm going to have it return...      

211
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,165
allSongs.      

212
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,666
So, return allSongs, like that.      

213
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:41,108
so we'll go async, and we'll make this a task      

214
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:44,564
that will return allSongs, and allSongs      

215
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:49,565
is an ObservableCollection... of StorageFile.      

216
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,339
So that will setup the music list,      

217
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,540
I feel good about that.      

218
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:01,699
We'll do something like this...      

219
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:14,868
all songs equals setup music list,      

220
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:20,815
and we'll await that, yeah, that should work.      

221
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,526
Then I'm going to create another private helper method,      

222
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,825
so private async...      

223
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:32,446
and right now it won't return anything,      

224
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:33,763
except a promise.      

225
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:37,763
PrepareNewGame.      

226
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,832
I guess, I'm going to pluck off some of this stuff here.      

227
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:04,486
The first thing I'm going to do is go      

228
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:06,833
songs.Clear(), so this would allow me      

229
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:09,692
to say, "Hey, whatever the previous collection of      

230
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:14,662
songs were when we played the game before      

231
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:17,371
in the last sessions, clear those songs out."      

232
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:19,184
So, this will allow me to reuse this method      

233
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:21,462
to prepare a brand new game.      

234
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,120
Then I'm going to grab randomSongs, let me see...      

235
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,392
I need to grab that as well.      

236
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,724
Actually, I don't want to do that.      

237
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,609
Let me think about this for a minute.      

238
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,026
I think what I want to do is make allSongs      

239
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:50,541
a public collection, or rather public to the class.      

240
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:55,542
So, ObservableCollection of StorageFile      

241
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:58,312
called all files, like that.      

242
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:02,098
Ok, that makes me feel good actually.      

243
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:06,108
We'll just do this...      

244
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:11,591
Let's not call it all files, let's call it all songs.      

245
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,073
And then here we'll just use all songs      

246
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:32,768
because we only really need to get those songs      

247
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,699
one time, but every time we want to play      

248
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,200
a new game we can reuse that list of songs.      

249
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:39,525
So that's kind of my thought process there.      

250
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:50,319
Probably, we'll need to do some other things,      

251
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,185
like we'll need to do some state management here,      

252
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,708
and we'll get to that later.      

253
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,761
Back to page loaded, so I do all that to do this.      

254
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:08,762
I'm going StartupProgressRing.IsActive equals true.      

255
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:13,926
Then I'm going to set up the music list,      

256
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:19,831
then I'm going to await prepare new game,      

257
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:24,988
then I'm going to call StartupProgressRing.IsActive      

258
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:28,257
equals false... great.      

259
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:31,233
Let's see if this actually works.      

260
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,377
So I forgot a couple of things here.      

261
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,052
Alright, let's see if this will even build.      

262
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,361
It did not like something here.      

263
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,004
It has the wrong return type.      

264
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:27,822
It does not like that I have put this here,      

265
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:32,478
so let's go ahead and rethink that a bit.      

266
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,288
Let's go private void here, and      

267
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,378
instead of putting all of this here,      

268
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:41,976
I need to make sure at a minimum,      

269
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:46,078
this Grid actually ready for action.      

270
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:51,664
On the Grid itself...      

271
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:53,525
I'm going to get rid of this background.      

272
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:01,926
Alright, and now we'll stick them in there.      

273
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:04,246
I think I can do this and then...      

274
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:12,964
async task... I should probably be able to do void there.      

275
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:18,923
Let's build it and see what happens.      

276
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:30,389
So build went well.      

277
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,252
Oh my goodness, it worked, look at that.      

278
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:34,335
How cool is that?      

279
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:36,750
Alright, so we were able to data bind.      

280
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,561
Got some margin issues here at the top.      

281
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:43,160
This doesn't do anything when we click on these items,      

282
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:45,289
but we're in really good shape here.      

283
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,336
I'm almost thinking that's all I      

284
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,819
really wanted to accomplish.      

285
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,061
Let me add around this,      

286
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,471
let's go margin...      

287
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,991
20 20 20...      

288
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,431
That should help that.      

289
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:08,629
Oh did you notice the little...      

290
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:16,296
The ProgressRing popped up too, that's awesome.      

291
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:18,020
Ok, one other thing I want to do with      

292
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,912
my StackPanel here.      

293
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:30,072
Let's go up and put margin equals 20      

294
00:19:30,072 --> 00:19:32,434
and that should just do for all sides.      

295
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,558
Nice, ok, very good.      

296
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:46,246
Alright, so that's pretty exciting.      

297
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,862
We made a lot of progress here      

298
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:49,387
in a short amount of time,      

299
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,531
so I'm going to go ahead and stop right here.      

300
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:53,548
We'll pick it back up in the next lesson.
