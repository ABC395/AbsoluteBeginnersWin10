1
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:10,199
Okay, the goal in this finallesson is to demonstrate how to      

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,100
integrate Cortanainto our application.      

3
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:18,740
And I created a small examplecalled Cortana Example.      

4
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:24,780
And it's meant to illustrate, inthe most simplest way possible,      

5
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,400
how to integrate Cortanainto your application.      

6
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:31,770
I don't think you'll finda simpler example out there.      

7
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:32,920
So watch what it can do.      

8
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:34,929
Hey, Cortana.      

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,547
[SOUND] In example appadd a red rectangle.      

10
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:45,226
>> All right,adding a rectangle.      

11
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:47,097
>> Hey, Cortana.      

12
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:52,838
[SOUND] In example app,add a blue circle.      

13
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:56,304
>> Sure, adding a circle.      

14
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:57,550
>> Hey, Cortana.      

15
00:00:57,551 --> 00:01:02,511
[SOUND] In example app,add a rectangle.      

16
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:07,051
[SOUND]>> Sure, adding a rectangle.      

17
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:07,891
>> Okay so hopefully      

18
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:10,350
you'll see that there werethree scenarios here.      

19
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:13,900
In the first scenario, I gaveboth the color and the shape.      

20
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:17,610
And the second example, I gavea color and a different shape.      

21
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,430
And then the third example,I gave only the shape and      

22
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,190
let Cortana decide whatthe color should be.      

23
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,690
Except Cortana's notquite that smart.      

24
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,790
You have to give it a littlebit more information than that.      

25
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,370
And I'll demonstratethat in this video.      

26
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:36,900
All right, so let me show youhow I created this application.      

27
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,550
It all starts with somethingcalled a voice command      

28
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:40,910
dictionary.      

29
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:44,340
This allows you to createa series of voice commands that      

30
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,300
Cortana will respond to foryour application.      

31
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:51,806
And so in this case you can seethat I've created this XML file.      

32
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:22,601
It follows a veryspecific schema,      

33
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,860
as laid out here inthe XML namespace.      

34
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:27,820
We'll talk about where tofind that in just a moment.      

35
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:33,380
You create a set of commandscalled CommandSet for      

36
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:38,700
every language and region thatyour application will support.      

37
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,960
So in our case,this is the English-US version.      

38
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:44,810
And it's also important to notethat Cortana's not available      

39
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,340
in every region andevery language just yet.      

40
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:54,077
So, the next thing that I dois create a command prefix and      

41
00:02:54,078 --> 00:03:00,430
this is why I said hey, hmm,in example app whatever, okay.      

42
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,540
So this means thatshe's listening for      

43
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:08,570
this specific command prefix sothat she can identify your      

44
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:13,130
application and send the commandto your application as opposed      

45
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:16,410
to other applications thatmight be running at that time.      

46
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:18,500
You see here that Ihave two commands.      

47
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,920
One is addRectangle andthe other is addCircle.      

48
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:24,680
These names are importantbecause I'm gonna utilize them      

49
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:27,640
from within our codein just a moment.      

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,620
Here I have a seriesof ListenFor elements.      

51
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:37,880
And this will allow me togive variations on a command      

52
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,480
that she can stillrespond to and      

53
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:44,360
it still all triggerthe add rectangle command.      

54
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,050
So in this first caseshe's listening for      

55
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:49,520
add a rectangle, in the secondcase she's listening for      

56
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,290
add a color rectangle.      

57
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:57,430
Now, the little brackets arounda in this case are important,      

58
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,530
because thoseare optional words.      

59
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,270
So you could say addrectangle or add a rectangle.      

60
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:07,518
Furthermore, if you already usethe color you would have to say      

61
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,134
add a color rectangle.      

62
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:14,200
So I didn't use the squarebrackets around the word a.      

63
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,100
Now as far asthe color is concerned,      

64
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:20,200
you can see that it'susing curly braces.      

65
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,230
And if you look below,      

66
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:25,550
there's a phrase list that goesalong with that label color.      

67
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:28,930
Here we can listen to colorsred, blue, yellow and green.      

68
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,280
Any of those colors will be      

69
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:37,040
recognized by Cortanain this command.      

70
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,230
Then finally, you can see thatthere is a feedback command, and      

71
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:43,950
this is what she actuallysays back to the user.      

72
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,030
So, it says,      

73
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:48,450
okay, adding a rectangle,or okay, adding a circle.      

74
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:50,830
Now these are identicalexcept for      

75
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,920
the fact that I'm usingcircle versus a rectangle.      

76
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,190
And they triggerdifferent commands.      

77
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:58,430
Notice that there are othercommands that I'm not really      

78
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,300
using like thisnavigate command.      

79
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,010
That might be useful if I wannanavigate to a different page      

80
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,960
in an application.      

81
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,740
Not really gonnademonstrate that in this.      

82
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,170
This also is an example,      

83
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,800
think more just forreference than anything else.      

84
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,924
So that you can rememberwhat this is used for.      

85
00:05:14,925 --> 00:05:19,686
There are also additionalelements that can be used inside      

86
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,990
of a command set.      

87
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:23,730
If you wanna learn moreabout command sets,      

88
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:25,420
here's what you need to do.      

89
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,422
Pop open your web browser.      

90
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:33,007
Go to dev.windows.com/cortana.      

91
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,480
Then scroll down andgo to Cortana Interactions,      

92
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:42,380
under the Get started area.      

93
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,140
And then if you take a lookat any of the articles      

94
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:50,390
that are inside of thisCortana integration section,      

95
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,920
you'll find example XML files.      

96
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,081
So, for example,in this first article,      

97
00:05:57,082 --> 00:06:00,385
launch a foreground app withvoice commands in Cortana.      

98
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:02,119
It talks about the VCD,      

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,417
or rather the VoiceCommand Dictionary, and      

100
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:07,690
it gives you some example XML.      

101
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:12,960
In fact, I just copied thisXML and paste it into my own      

102
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:17,260
file that I called,CortanaExampleCommands.xml.      

103
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:19,725
So, you wanna referencethat page, again,      

104
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:23,640
dev.windows.com/cortana andthen navigate to      

105
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,670
Cortana integrations, andlook at the new articles there.      

106
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:31,550
It'll also give you additionalcommands that you can use for      

107
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,800
different scenarios.      

108
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:40,584
Okay so, after Cortanarecognizes the command      

109
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:45,331
prefix and the command itselfby using one of these listen for      

110
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:50,820
items to identify a specificcommand then what we wanna do      

111
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:56,480
is actually receive input forthe application.      

112
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,930
Now what I had todo was override      

113
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:06,330
a method called on activated.      

114
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,040
And specifically,      

115
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,910
I want to know how thisapplication was activated.      

116
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:17,040
Was it activated as a resultof a voice command?      

117
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,720
If it wasn't,then I wanna return.      

118
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:25,352
But if it was, then I'mgonna grab out the command      

119
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:28,342
arguments that were passed in-      

120
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:35,633
As I activated event args.      

121
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:38,991
And so we're casting themessentially to a specific      

122
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:43,200
type of event arg, called aVoiceCommandActivatedEventArgs.      

123
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:47,835
And then once we havethe command args for voice,      

124
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:49,428
we can grab off.      

125
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,834
The result propertyinto a variable      

126
00:07:55,835 --> 00:07:58,975
called speechRecognitionResultand      

127
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:03,782
here I can determine whichcommand was spoken, in which,      

128
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:08,920
the entire text, if I wantto parse through it myself.      

129
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:13,470
Additionally, I can use thatspeech recognition result to      

130
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:18,038
get at, which color inthe phrase list was      

131
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,475
selected, was spoken.      

132
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:26,670
And notice here that I'm justindexing N in both cases to      

133
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:30,340
the first item.      

134
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:33,450
It's possible that thereare multiple commands and      

135
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,780
multiple phrase liststhat were cast in.      

136
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,390
So we're describingthe first one,      

137
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,290
and then the rest is reallyjust logic in my application.      

138
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:45,570
In this case, I'm going tocompare the spokenColor that we      

139
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:51,150
grabbed off from the semanticinterpretation of properties      

140
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:54,770
indexing into the color label.      

141
00:08:54,771 --> 00:09:02,400
And then I just make sure thatwe return a windows.ui.color and      

142
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,920
now what I want to do is geta reference to the main page.      

143
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,160
And I'm gonna determineby the voice command.      

144
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:12,400
Was it addRectangle oraddCircle.      

145
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:16,330
And either way,I'm gonna call a method on      

146
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:17,990
the page that I just gota reference to here.      

147
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,400
And I pass in the colorthat was selected.      

148
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,710
So back in the MainPage.xaml,      

149
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:30,530
I just made a two publicmethods, here's a public      

150
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:34,005
void create rectangle and here'sa public void create circle.      

151
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,340
They're pretty much identicalasking the color and      

152
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:39,990
just printing the randomleft and top.      

153
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,890
And then creating a new instanceof that particular object.      

154
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,990
In this case an Ellipse.      

155
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:49,730
Giving it a width and      

156
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:53,940
height and a margin and then Iuse the fill, I use the color to      

157
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:57,360
create a solid color brush thatI apply to the fill property.      

158
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,100
And then I just make it a child      

159
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,530
by adding it to the layoutgrid that I have.      

160
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:04,592
So, pretty simple right?      

161
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:09,190
All right, so let's use the whatwe learned in this example to      

162
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,380
add Cortana integrationinto our application.      

163
00:10:13,602 --> 00:10:14,900
So what I'm goingto do actually is,      

164
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:17,410
kind of put this overto the side here.      

165
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:24,530
And then, I'm going toopen up our application.      

166
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,620
The first thing I want to do tomy application is add new item.      

167
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:33,390
I'm gonna add a voicecommand dictionary.      

168
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:36,390
So I'm gonna scroll down tilI find the XML file, and      

169
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:40,770
I'll call thisVoiceCommandDictionary.      

170
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,980
Oh there is one last thingI need to show you as well.      

171
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,070
From that previous project.      

172
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:50,490
Let me drag it backinto view here.      

173
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,380
One thing I didn't show you waswe need to load up that voice      

174
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:59,050
command dictionary and I do thathere in the Page_Loaded event.      

175
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,550
So I'm gonna go out andsay hey I wanna grab      

176
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:07,750
this Cortana examplecommand set xml file and      

177
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:12,560
I wanna load it into my commanddefinition manager by calling      

178
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:17,170
the install command definitionfrom storage file a sync method,      

179
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:20,310
passing in the storage file Icreate a reference to here.      

180
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:24,930
All right, sohopefully that makes sense.      

181
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,100
So now what I'm gonna do isactually open up that previous      

182
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,250
voice command dictionary.      

183
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,870
And I'm going to paste it in      

184
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,740
to my newVoiceCommandDictionary.xml.      

185
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,802
And of course I'm gonnachange everything up.      

186
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:45,343
I'm gonna call this commandprefix Hero Explorer.      

187
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:52,722
And the example will berefresh the character list.      

188
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:57,127
So I'm only gonnahave one command and      

189
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:59,620
it's not gonna have a phraselist associated with it.      

190
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:02,010
So we'll just go ahead andget rid of all that.      

191
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:03,800
This is gonna be a verysimple implementation.      

192
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,718
I'm gonna call thiscommand refresh and      

193
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:11,337
the example will be somethinglike refresh the character list.      

194
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:24,453
And we'll give a coupleof variations on this so      

195
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:29,320
Refresh [the] character list.      

196
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:36,787
Or even just refresh      

197
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:43,390
the characters.      

198
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,500
And I might even just makethis character also optional.      

199
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,860
I don't know if I can do that,we'll just throw that in there.      

200
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,970
So, you can just sayrefresh list, or      

201
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,730
refresh characters,or refresh the list,      

202
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,900
or refresh the character list,refresh the characters.      

203
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,820
A lot of differentways to get that is.      

204
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:02,230
And the feedback we want,is refreshing.      

205
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,220
Character list.      

206
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:09,550
All right, so that part's done.      

207
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:12,110
The next thing that I wanna dois go to the app.zamzar file.      

208
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:17,150
Let's open it up here, and I'mgonna override a method that you      

209
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:21,170
cannot see, and I'm actuallyjust gonna copy, and      

210
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:25,800
paste it from thisCortana example And      

211
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:27,470
then we'll strip out the thingswe don't need from it.      

212
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,480
So I definitelywon't need colors.      

213
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:34,860
It doesn't like that anywaycuz I don't have the proper      

214
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:35,880
namespaces added.      

215
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,470
That's fine.      

216
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:39,040
Get rid of that.      

217
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,300
And there are other thingswe need like spokenColor.      

218
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,160
We don't need to graboff anything like that.      

219
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:44,630
We can just remove all of that.      

220
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,620
I don't need the textthat was actually spoken.      

221
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:50,700
All I really need to do is makesure that the voice command is      

222
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:54,640
indeed the commandthat we're looking for.      

223
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:57,640
So I can actually get ridof most of this as well.      

224
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,735
And I just want to make surethat the voiceCommandName      

225
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,030
= "refresh".      

226
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,370
That's what she passed in.      

227
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:10,475
And if it is then we'll      

228
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:16,130
call into our publicmethod on our main page.      

229
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:18,530
We'll print that injust a little bit.      

230
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,120
But I'll get rid of all of here.      

231
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:20,840
All of this rather.      

232
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,490
So, and this greatlysimplifies the application.      

233
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,970
Everything else thatneeds to be there,      

234
00:14:27,971 --> 00:14:32,120
we've eliminated allthe fluff that we don't need.      

235
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:32,850
Okay, great.      

236
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,398
Now in the mainpage.xml.cswhat I want to do.      

237
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,625
In the Page_Loaded eventis actually load up at      

238
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:50,441
that VoiceCommandDictionaryfile.      

239
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,020
So I think I'll actually do thatfirst before we go off into      

240
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,210
populating the mobilecharacters so that we can place      

241
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,300
in this third record, and we'llchange the name of the file      

242
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:10,290
cuz I need this one voiceCommandDictionary.xml.      

243
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:14,550
Otherwise, everythingcan stay the same.      

244
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,836
But I do need to createsomething that we can call from      

245
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:25,210
the app.xml.cs fromthat OnActivated event.      

246
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:29,500
So, here's where I needto make some decisions.      

247
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:33,726
I think I could really just take      

248
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:39,100
virtually everythinginside of this.      

249
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:40,680
In fact, let me just go aheadand grab everything up here.      

250
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,410
Take all this andI'll put it in a method.      

251
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:47,270
Called refresh.      

252
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,775
So we do that.      

253
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:53,930
Go public async      

254
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:58,720
void Refresh().      

255
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:01,150
And its only job willbe to do all that.      

256
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,881
And then we'll callRefresh from here.      

257
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,189
And this also sets us up tocreate some user interface      

258
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,753
element that you canclick on to refresh, but      

259
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:17,870
we're not gonna dothat in this video.      

260
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:20,700
Or in this series of videos,for that matter.      

261
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,520
Okay, so that looks good.      

262
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:25,433
Let's make sure itall compiles here.      

263
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,210
All right hopefully Ididn't forget a step.      

264
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:34,870
I think we're in good shape,let's make sure.      

265
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:38,700
Oh, I need to go back here tothe app.xaml.cs, that's right.      

266
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:42,393
And here I need togo page.Refresh.      

267
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,592
Yeah, yeah.      

268
00:16:44,593 --> 00:16:45,763
We'll just get rid of that.      

269
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:47,713
And that as well.      

270
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:48,589
All right,      

271
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,892
in fact for that matter, I canget rid of that and that too.      

272
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:55,389
Okay, great.      

273
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,175
So let me go ahead and give it awhirl and see what happens here.      

274
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:01,222
Let me go back toour local machine.      

275
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:05,559
Run the application.      

276
00:17:09,754 --> 00:17:12,841
Okay, so it looks like westart with New Warriors.      

277
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:14,683
Go on from there.      

278
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:15,962
So, here we go.      

279
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:16,640
Hey, Cortana.      

280
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,580
In Hero Explorer,refresh the characters.      

281
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,056
>> Refreshingthe character list.      

282
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:32,423
>> All right, sothat didn't work.      

283
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,540
Let's put a break point here,and      

284
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,320
see if we ever get tothis inactivated event.      

285
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:41,910
We'll stick this right there,and let's run it again.      

286
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,570
Oh I see what the problem is.      

287
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,542
We were already at tencharacters [LAUGH].      

288
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:48,710
All right soa little bug in the logic.      

289
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,205
That's not a problem.      

290
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:55,360
So let's goMarvelCharacters.Clear[ ].      

291
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:57,750
And that should fixthe problem now.      

292
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,060
Let's go ahead andget rid of that.      

293
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,800
And we'll go ahead andgo to that and      

294
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:05,675
it should work this time.      

295
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:12,974
Hey Cortana.      

296
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:17,470
In hero explorer,refresh the character list.      

297
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,570
>> Sure thing.      

298
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:19,710
Refreshing the character list.      

299
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:21,940
>> All right, sowe started out with death bird.      

300
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:22,900
Everything went away.      

301
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,132
Now we'll start adding new ones.      

302
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:30,847
All right, andyou can see it's working.      

303
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,016
All right, great.      

304
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:34,006
So Cortana integration was easy,      

305
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:37,195
especially once you figureout all your logic issues.      

306
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:41,270
[LAUGH] Butyou obviously can expand this.      

307
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,430
I only showed youa simple scenario.      

308
00:18:43,431 --> 00:18:45,310
The application wasalready running.      

309
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:48,320
There's also another scenariowhere you can create      

310
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:50,780
a background task that'sconstantly listening,      

311
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,780
even when yourapplication's not running.      

312
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,860
And it can launchyour application and      

313
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:59,720
then give it the Cortana commandthat the user spoke to Cortana.      

314
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,840
Again, an advanced example.      

315
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,470
You can find that inthe universal Windows apps      

316
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,610
examples on GitHub,      

317
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:10,580
which I'm gonna give you thelink to in the very next video.      

318
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:13,540
In fact, that's a good segue tothe next video because we're      

319
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,690
gonna wrap up this series.      

320
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm gonna give yousome places to look for      

321
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:20,870
other great, great resources andthat's one of them.      

322
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:23,210
But, see how easy it wasto integrate Cortana?      

323
00:19:23,211 --> 00:19:25,690
So, you're gonna find that      

324
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:27,490
people will want thislevel of integration.      

325
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,300
This is one ofthe coolest new features      

326
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,590
to come out ofMicrosoft in a while.      

327
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:33,260
All right, so let's wrapit up in the next video.      

328
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,400
We'll see you there.      

329
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:34,900
Thanks.
