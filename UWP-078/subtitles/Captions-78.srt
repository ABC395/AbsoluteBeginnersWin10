1
00:00:05,742 --> 00:00:09,723
And one of the last big tasksthat I wanna tackle is adaptive      

2
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:12,190
layout for an application.      

3
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,850
Recall what we wanted toaccomplish was to take      

4
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:16,510
the details from the right and      

5
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:20,480
move it under the list wheneverwe're in a narrow layout.      

6
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:22,160
But when we're in a wide layout,      

7
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,590
then we want it to bewhere it's at right now.      

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,740
So we'll adda VisualStateManager and      

9
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:31,880
some VisualStates, andwe'll get it to work.      

10
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,970
And then we'll do any cleanup on the UI that we need to      

11
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:37,730
before we add our lastfeature in the next video.      

12
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:39,733
So let's go ahead andget started here.      

13
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm going to, underneath thisfirst grid that I added in      

14
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:47,707
the previous video, I'm goingto start with the visual state      

15
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:50,910
manager and add a bunchof visual state groups.      

16
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:55,136
We'll create one visual stategroup called Visual State Group.      

17
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,372
And then I'm gonna create.      

18
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,908
A single visual state,and I'll copy and      

19
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,050
paste it to create a second one.      

20
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,130
So this first one,we're gonna call Wide.      

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,045
And this one will be valid,with the state trigger.      

22
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:32,777
So VisualState.StateTriggers andlet me go ahead and      

23
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:37,908
create VisualState.Setters,great.      

24
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:40,188
And here are the triggers,      

25
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,666
the minimum windowwidth will be 800.      

26
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:49,148
We can test this with our phoneto make sure it looks good,      

27
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,710
with the phone emulatorthat that will work.      

28
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:57,150
If not, well, I think itwill be fine on the phone.      

29
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,460
It's just a matter ofthe desktop, how it looks.      

30
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,650
Any rate, we'll test it.      

31
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,270
All right, setters.      

32
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:05,090
Here we go.Setter Target=,      

33
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,490
okay, so this is where thingsstart to get interesting, right.      

34
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,877
What we really wanna do is take,let's see, we take this detail      

35
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,291
grid, everything insideof the detail grid, and      

36
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:19,590
you know it doescontain quite a bit.      

37
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:23,410
And we wanna move it toa different column and      

38
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:29,290
row based on the currentvisual state.      

39
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,900
I think I've lost my mind here,there we go.      

40
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,760
So I wanna setthe detail grids row and      

41
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:44,250
column appropriately, andto do that, I'm gonna need to      

42
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:49,310
access it through its name, butI'm using attached properties.      

43
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:52,084
So how do I do that?      

44
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:56,269
Well, I think wedo it like this,      

45
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,455
DetailGrid.(Grid.Row) and      

46
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:04,489
we set its value equal to 0, and      

47
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:10,910
we'll do somethingsimilar with a column.      

48
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:14,795
So the column value would be 1.      

49
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,360
And then let's go ahead and copythis visual state, paste it,      

50
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,590
and we wanna set the minimumwindow width for      

51
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:29,210
this one to 0, andthis is gonna be narrow.      

52
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,940
And we're gonna reverse it.      

53
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:35,290
The row will be 1 andthe column will be 0,      

54
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,292
and the narrow VisualState.      

55
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:39,994
All right,let's see what we have, and      

56
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:42,612
then we may need to make someother adjustments based on that.      

57
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,054
Okay, solet's go ahead and select.      

58
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:55,696
Our data, and just go ahead andget all queued up here.      

59
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:04,111
All right,we have one comic book left.      

60
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,552
Okay, great.      

61
00:04:05,553 --> 00:04:09,040
And it looks like I still havesome issues here on the right.      

62
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,390
We'll have to work on thatin the UI cleanup phase.      

63
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:15,030
I'm gonna get to a certainpoint, where it goes off screen,      

64
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,460
and you can see it below.      

65
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,859
Boy, that does notlook good at all.      

66
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,730
So, I think we're gonna needto make one more change and      

67
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,395
then a little bitof clean up here.      

68
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,826
The change that we need to make,and      

69
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,700
let's just pick anotherone of these as well.      

70
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:32,740
Let's pick Carnage.      

71
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:36,048
Let's see if we get anythinginteresting there, no.      

72
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:42,067
All right, there we go.      

73
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,250
Okay, gets a littlemore interesting there.      

74
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,640
You'll notice that these runoff to the side of the screen.      

75
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:49,040
When we had a description ora title,      

76
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,020
it ran off to the sideof the screen.      

77
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:55,300
And I think the problemthere is the width for      

78
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,530
this entire column right here.      

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,306
So, let's set that.      

80
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:09,242
And to do that, I'm gonnagive this topmost grid,      

81
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,490
the columns here, names.      

82
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:15,510
And I can do that byusing the x:Name= and      

83
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:18,890
we'll just callthis "ColumnOne".      

84
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:25,364
And we'll do the same thing forthe second column, like so.      

85
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:33,223
So here in the wide state,      

86
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:36,889
what we wanna do is set      

87
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:44,854
the SetterTarget="ColumnOne.Width".      

88
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:47,304
And we'll make surethat's set to Auto.      

89
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,554
And then Column.      

90
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,729
Two.width.      

91
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,058
We'll set that to *.      

92
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:04,016
And then we'll dothe exact opposite.      

93
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:11,977
When we hit the narrow one,so we'll hit the * there and      

94
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:18,117
Auto there, and hopefully,that'll fix the problem.      

95
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:19,509
Okay, let's run it again.      

96
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,071
Okay, we'll pickUnion Jack there.      

97
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:39,430
All right.      

98
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,249
Great.      

99
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,766
All right,      

100
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,470
looks like I do still have somethings falling off to the side.      

101
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:50,370
I think I need towrap the title there.      

102
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:55,500
Honestly, I'll wrap all thetitles, and then I need to add      

103
00:06:55,501 --> 00:07:00,580
some more margin on the righthand side here for this.      

104
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:04,098
So let's do this.      

105
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:10,179
Let's come down tothe comic detail.      

106
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,558
And I want to.      

107
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:19,553
Nope, move thatover a little bit.      

108
00:07:19,554 --> 00:07:23,279
I want to add in thissome text wrapping.      

109
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,042
So let's go,TextWrapping="Wrap".      

110
00:07:29,043 --> 00:07:32,474
And I think I'm gonna goahead and do the same thing,      

111
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:34,970
even though we didn'tsee it happen,      

112
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:39,120
I wanna do the same thing forthe DetailNameTextBlock as well.      

113
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,890
That should handle that problem.      

114
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:47,100
Now I'm also gonna want to addsome margin on the right there      

115
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,300
in both of these cases.      

116
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:52,340
So I'm gonna put 10pixels to the right.      

117
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,520
That will give usa little breathing room.      

118
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,426
All right,let's see what happens now.      

119
00:07:58,516 --> 00:07:59,746
Let's pick Klaw.      

120
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,394
Looks like it's still grabbing,okay, great.      

121
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:10,810
All right, I like that.      

122
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:12,354
It doesn't buttright up against it.      

123
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:15,627
That's good, that's good,looks great.      

124
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,551
Let's pick another one here.      

125
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:20,388
That looks good.      

126
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:25,337
You can see that this wasintended to be used in HTML.      

127
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,780
[LAUGH] Let's pick Bishop.      

128
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,310
It's a pretty coolpicture of Bishop.      

129
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,760
We're still waiting forthe comics to roll in.      

130
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:38,243
There we go.      

131
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:41,483
All right, Cable, good.      

132
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:42,886
Good, good, good.      

133
00:08:42,887 --> 00:08:44,141
That looks awesome.      

134
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:45,824
Okay, very cool.      

135
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,424
All right, and so      

136
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:52,987
now let's see what it looks likewhen we actually scroll out.      

137
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:56,447
Okay, still looks good,looks great.      

138
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:59,747
All right,the next thing I wanna do, and      

139
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:04,274
I'm really enjoying this andenjoying the way it looks,      

140
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,558
I'm gonna try it on a phone.      

141
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,520
So let's put it in the mobileemulator and run it there,      

142
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,736
just to make sureeverything looks good.      

143
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,434
All right, there we go.      

144
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:23,093
Let's go ahead andselect one of these items.      

145
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,635
You can see it's listed below.      

146
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:29,072
Boy, that description area isgoing to be awfully small.      

147
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:35,132
But ultimately, yeah.      

148
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,651
I wish there was an easyway to wrap around.      

149
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, we might wannathink about that.      

150
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,268
I don't really have a goodsolution in mind just yet.      

151
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:52,430
Other than [LAUGH] Icould put this whole area      

152
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:56,280
in a user control, andthen whenever we're in      

153
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:58,710
the narrow width,we could change its layout too.      

154
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,200
But that's not somethingI wanna take on.      

155
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,730
I didn't even think about theway this would look on a phone.      

156
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:06,860
But that would be the next stepthat I would have to take if I      

157
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:09,700
was wanting to releasethis into the wild.      

158
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:12,300
Okay, but I think it'sgood enough for now.      

159
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,450
I have one more cool featurethat I wanna add, and      

160
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:18,350
that is Cortana integration.      

161
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,140
So excited about that.      

162
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,472
We'll learn about itin the next lesson.      

163
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:22,610
We'll see you there, thanks.
