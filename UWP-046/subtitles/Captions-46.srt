1
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:04,697
<v Voiceover>Allright, so the next thing</v>      

2
00:00:04,698 --> 00:00:07,674
that we're going to do is work on the      

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,587
Data Model, and then we'll do some initial Binding,      

4
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:13,574
and then re-work it a little bit in another video.      

5
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:16,357
So the first thing we do is add a Model folder,      

6
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:18,749
so I'm just going to select the project name,      

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,624
go over to Projects and Add New Folder,      

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,772
and call it Model.      

9
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,807
And inside of there I'm going to add another Class called,      

10
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:31,880
I'll call mine NewsItem.      

11
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:33,696
You can call it whatever you like, but ultimately,      

12
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:36,546
I'm going to be creating a new POCO      

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,764
called NewsItem.      

14
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:45,215
And I'll create an ID, although we won't really use that.      

15
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:52,161
Create a Category,      

16
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:58,414
Headline.      

17
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:01,611
Also create      

18
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:06,875
Subhead,      

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,590
DateLine,      

20
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:17,316
and the Image Path.      

21
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,849
All right, so the next thing we're going to need to do then      

22
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,916
is to create a,      

23
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:36,358
a class I want to call the      

24
00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:39,365
NewsFactory, I guess.      

25
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,625
I could call it NewsManager,      

26
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,635
either of those I think would apply in this situation.      

27
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:47,536
And that's,      

28
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:49,188
and when I use the word Manager or Factory      

29
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:51,626
I'm invoking patterns,      

30
00:01:51,627 --> 00:01:53,581
design patterns for software developers.      

31
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:57,241
Factories are classes that allow you create instances      

32
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,535
of new objects, so whenever there,      

33
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,759
the creation of an object's complex,      

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,071
you can delegate that to another class entirely.      

35
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:10,232
I might call this a Manager instead, though.      

36
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,045
Manager really denotes      

37
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:17,475
the ability to interact with the POCO object      

38
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:19,545
against any persistence,      

39
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:21,752
and we would probably have,      

40
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:24,074
if this were a real application some sort of persistence,      

41
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:25,960
so I'm going to go with NewsManager instead,      

42
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:27,478
now that I think about it a little bit more.      

43
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,549
Naming things is hard.      

44
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,592
I think I've said that before in this series.      

45
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:37,482
And you want to connote the right idea      

46
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:41,391
of the role that a given class or property      

47
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,459
or variable is playing      

48
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:47,622
inside of your system.      

49
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,280
Okay, so what the plan here is that      

50
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:54,678
I'm going to pass in an empty,      

51
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:57,763
or even a populated ObservableCollection      

52
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,481
of type NewsItem,      

53
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:07,191
and then I'm going to use this method      

54
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,238
to remove what's already in it,      

55
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,596
and populate it with all the items that fit      

56
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,559
the given category that you're passing in as well.      

57
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:19,172
Alright, so let's go ahead and get ObservableCollection,      

58
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:20,942
I'm going to hit Control+"." on the keyboard,      

59
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,207
pops up IntelliSense.      

60
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,610
I'm going to grab that Using statement there at the top.      

61
00:03:25,611 --> 00:03:27,725
And we should be good now.      

62
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:28,645
Great.      

63
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,807
And so, I think what I'm also going to do      

64
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:34,073
is actually delegate the actual creation      

65
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:37,268
of this master List of items      

66
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:40,167
to another method.      

67
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:44,170
So I'm going to go private static List,      

68
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,856
<NewsItem>,      

69
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:49,009
called getNewsItems.      

70
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,949
And this is just a helper method.      

71
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,422
And it's going to do the hard work here.      

72
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:02,461
Okay.      

73
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,688
And ultimately we will return this items.      

74
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:12,097
And I've been fightin' the telesense because I      

75
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,236
spelled items incorrectly.      

76
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:16,099
There we go.      

77
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,893
Alright, and now if you'll excuse me,      

78
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,411
well I'll go ahead and type in the first one.      

79
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:20,720
We're going to paste in      

80
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:23,505
everything that I've done here,      

81
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:25,664
and I'll walk through it so you can look at it.      

82
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:32,566
So I'm using an object initializer syntax      

83
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,073
inside of the Add for the collection,      

84
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,221
so I'll do something like add ID = 1;      

85
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:39,854
Category equals,      

86
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,557
I probably should use an enum for this,      

87
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:43,692
but I'm going to be lazy      

88
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:46,127
and just use a hard-putted string.      

89
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:49,668
And then      

90
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,697
for the Headline,      

91
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,875
I'm going to set that equal to Lorem      

92
00:04:58,362 --> 00:04:59,463
Ipsum      

93
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:03,161
Subhead, I'll set that equal to      

94
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,464
some other fake Latin      

95
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:09,920
that I have no idea what it means.      

96
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:14,932
Set the DateLine equal to...      

97
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:27,697
And then I'm going to set the Image equal to      

98
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:31,007
Assets/Financial1.png      

99
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:33,284
Assets/Financial1.png.      

100
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:35,165
Alright, so you can see that I fumbled through      

101
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:38,012
and typed all of that out.      

102
00:05:39,258 --> 00:05:40,356
Now here's what I'm going to do.      

103
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:42,985
I'm going to copy and paste      

104
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:44,653
all the rest of the items      

105
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,268
from work I've done previously from my notes.      

106
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:51,436
And I tell you what I'm going to do.      

107
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:53,044
I'm going to give you,      

108
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:56,723
I'll actually, I'll tell you what.      

109
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,823
Before you actually take possession      

110
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:02,333
of, here, actually, I'll give you this whole thing.      

111
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,335
I'm going to put this      

112
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:07,380
in our little instructions, here.      

113
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:10,207
So I'm going to add this to the bottom, like so,      

114
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,921
and you can just copy and paste it all out,      

115
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,083
and I'll make a note right above it like right here.      

116
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,843
So by the time that you receive this,      

117
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,591
you'll get all of this extra stuff in there      

118
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:23,248
that'll help you create all of the newsItems, okay.      

119
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,377
So that should make it easy for both of us (laughs).      

120
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:27,826
Alright, so now what I want to do      

121
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,660
is just call into that,      

122
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:36,837
call into that helper method to grab all the items      

123
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:41,100
and then I'm going to get a filtered List of the Items,      

124
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:44,785
so filteredNewsItems = allItems,      

125
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:51,386
where and, so we'll filter by Category,      

126
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,042
like so.      

127
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:58,950
And once we have that, I'm going to      

128
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:04,257
convert it to a List, like that.      

129
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:07,824
And now I'm going to take the newsItems      

130
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,054
that were passed in and call clear on them.      

131
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,605
So empty out everything that's in there.      

132
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:15,545
And then I'm going to go, a filteredNewsItems,      

133
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:19,137
whoa, man, I am spelling Items wrong today.      

134
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,047
There we go.      

135
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,708
filteredNewsItems, and then,      

136
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,640
I need to add each of the individual      

137
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,216
items in the list to ObservableCollection.      

138
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:36,516
There's no easy way to convert,      

139
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:39,504
so let me do this.      

140
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:43,393
This is a nice little trick.      

141
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:47,509
This ForEach link extension method will go through      

142
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,325
each individual item, in my newsItem,      

143
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,547
in the filteredNewsItems,      

144
00:07:58,548 --> 00:08:02,136
and it will add that filteredNewsItem      

145
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:06,225
to my ObservableCollection of newsItem, like so.      

146
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:10,565
Whoops, there we go. (laughs)      

147
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,449
Okay, that should work.      

148
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:16,038
Okay, so just to explain that again.      

149
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,279
Here I'm grabbing all the newsItems that we create      

150
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,649
in our List of newsItem.      

151
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,584
Here I'm going to filter and only grab those out      

152
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:26,269
from the Category that was passed in.      

153
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,983
I'm going to convert that to a List,      

154
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:31,214
and then I'm going to clear out all the items      

155
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:33,537
that are currently in the ObservableCollection      

156
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:34,845
of newsItem.      

157
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,720
Now I want to go through and do a ForEach      

158
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:41,836
on every single item in the filteredNewsItems,      

159
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,249
and for each Item in that collection,      

160
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,475
I'm going to add it to this ObservableCollection of newsItem.      

161
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:51,534
So that should work.      

162
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:52,865
That should be just fine.      

163
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:57,122
Now what I want to do is, in my MainPage,      

164
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:58,706
I'm going to need to      

165
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:04,455
go here and I want to do a private ObservableCollection,      

166
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:12,596
ObservableCollection,      

167
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,501
of NewsItem      

168
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:18,345
called NewsItems.      

169
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,243
Alright, let's make sure I spelled that right.      

170
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:26,176
Now I want to add using statements to get      

171
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:31,814
both my NewsItem and the ObservableCollection      

172
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:34,044
into this code file,      

173
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:36,387
and then in the MainPage,      

174
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:38,874
in the constructor for the Page,      

175
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:39,932
what I'll do it populate it.      

176
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,852
Go NewsItems = new      

177
00:09:42,853 --> 00:09:44,681
ObservableCollection<NewsItem>,      

178
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:47,059
well at least I'll create a new instance of it rather,      

179
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,229
and then      

180
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,058
when the Page is loaded,      

181
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:58,139
what we'll do is Page load,      

182
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,742
and we'll create EventHandler for that,      

183
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:09,294
and here I'm going to make sure that the      

184
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:12,111
Financial tab is selected.      

185
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,316
And then here, I'll go Financial dot,      

186
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,547
if that's true, if Financial.IsSelected,      

187
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:21,212
we'll do something else,      

188
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:24,890
if Food.IsSelected we'll do something else.      

189
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,590
Like that, okay.      

190
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,048
Let's go ahead and get these on other lines.      

191
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,337
Like so. Great.      

192
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:36,082
So here I'm going to call      

193
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:41,811
the NewsManager.GetNews,      

194
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:44,705
and I'm going to say give me all the Financial Items,      

195
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:49,373
and I'm going to pass in the newsItems like that.      

196
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:52,686
Pull in the newsItems.      

197
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:58,345
And I'm going to also set the Title Block's Text      

198
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:01,539
equal to Financial, like so.      

199
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:05,450
And then here we'll do the same thing,      

200
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:07,036
NewsManager.GetNews,      

201
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:11,424
whenever the Food Item is selected,      

202
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:16,029
the ListView item called Food is selected.      

203
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,950
So Food,      

204
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,993
and then News Items,      

205
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:25,526
and then the TitleTextBlock.Text      

206
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:26,811
equals Food.      

207
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:28,675
Great.      

208
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,057
And alright, so that should set that all up,      

209
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:35,897
and then the last thing I guess I need to do      

210
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:37,745
is come back over to the MainPage.xaml      

211
00:11:37,746 --> 00:11:42,311
and temporarily add stuff for this DataTemplate, so      

212
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:46,961
again, we'll be pulling this out eventually,      

213
00:11:46,962 --> 00:11:50,202
but for short term I can make this work.      

214
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:52,800
So let me,      

215
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:57,238
let me actually create a Grid,      

216
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:02,252
and the Grid's going to have two Rows.      

217
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:09,264
And so the top Row      

218
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,898
will have an Image,      

219
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:19,109
the Financial1.png, Food1.png,      

220
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,739
whatever the case might be.      

221
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:25,844
And then the next Row will actually have      

222
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:34,631
all of the Text in there that we want to store.      

223
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:38,128
Now we'll come back and we'll worry about      

224
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,771
how to change the Widths and the Heights appropriately,      

225
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,496
but I'm going to go ahead and hard code the Height="275"      

226
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:45,164
Height="275" for now,      

227
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,985
and we'll set the Width="200",      

228
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:50,931
and we'll change that based on the Width of the window      

229
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:52,981
and we'll use the VisualStateManager      

230
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:53,878
to accomplish that.      

231
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,660
I'm going to go ahead and set the Background="White" as well,      

232
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:58,910
and I'll give it a Margin all around "10".      

233
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:00,754
Alright.      

234
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:03,788
So let's start with      

235
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,819
the Image.      

236
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,085
So that'll be in the top Row,      

237
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,224
so I won't even set Grid.Row,      

238
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:13,280
and I'll set Name, MyImage.      

239
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,094
And then here we're going to set the source,      

240
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,652
and we'll do the x:Bind statement here.      

241
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:20,916
And that reminds me now,      

242
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,051
we need to do some other things here.      

243
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:27,146
Alright, so the DataTemplate. (exhales)      

244
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:30,044
x:DataType equals      

245
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:33,376
data:NewsItem,      

246
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:36,457
of course, we have not defined that namespace called Data,      

247
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,828
so let me do that, xmlns:data      

248
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:45,126
equals FakeNews.Model, like so.      

249
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,540
Alright, that should take care of that.      

250
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:54,182
And we're going to Bind to      

251
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,058
the Image.      

252
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:01,683
Then I'm going to add a RelativePanel,      

253
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:04,442
and in that RelativePanel I'm going to set that      

254
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,973
Grid.Row="1".      

255
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:09,043
And there's a bug with the RelativePanel.      

256
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:12,009
I think sometimes it manifests itself,      

257
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,401
and the bug is whenever it's used in the context      

258
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:16,448
of a DataTemplate, sometime it whacks out      

259
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,932
inside of the XAML editor, so if you get that problem      

260
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,806
with blue squiggly lines saying that      

261
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,647
it has to be set to Instance of UIElement.      

262
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:28,889
You're not the first one to encounter that.      

263
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,866
Maybe they'll fix that, I don't get it      

264
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,890
every time it's,      

265
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:35,250
it's an odd little bug, but,      

266
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,212
I've seen other people online      

267
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:38,912
say that they've had the same issue.      

268
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,522
So let me actually      

269
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:46,109
say that I want this to be Subhead,      

270
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:50,458
and I'll worry about the formatting of this later,      

271
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:51,559
make it look better.      

272
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,656
But I think that's all I'm really going to need right now.      

273
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:00,914
Now I still get this little blue squiggly line here,      

274
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:04,176
I think it's because you've gotta build your project.      

275
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:07,740
I had not built the project since I created the NewsItem      

276
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:12,524
class. Seems to work, and the blue squiggly goes away.      

277
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,131
Let's see what we have so far.      

278
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:16,732
Huh.      

279
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,155
That's not what I was expecting.      

280
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,523
Not what I was hoping for.      

281
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,365
Alright, I'm missing something obvious, I feel like.      

282
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:29,718
Oh, (chuckles) of course I'm missing something obvious.      

283
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:32,457
Can you see what I'm missing?      

284
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,315
I'll give you a hint, it's right in, it's in here.      

285
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:37,708
Yeah.      

286
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,523
What I'm missing is the ItemSource Property.      

287
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:43,971
Easy enough.      

288
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:46,527
And I've gotta give it      

289
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,803
that ObservableCollection of NewsItem      

290
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:50,584
that I called newsItems that I created here      

291
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:53,260
in the MainPage.xaml.cs.      

292
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:55,147
Right there.      

293
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:56,940
That's how it's going to all Bind itself together.      

294
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:58,755
So now let's see if it works.      

295
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,586
Alright, it's not pretty,      

296
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,909
definitely have some work to do with formatting,      

297
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,878
but I can see there's a lot of text on top of each other.      

298
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,263
That's okay for now.      

299
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:11,841
Let's see if that works, yeah,      

300
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:14,072
so I'm getting, I'm filtering correctly,      

301
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,705
that's all working nicely.      

302
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:17,545
All right, and I'll worry about the formatting      

303
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:20,029
of these guys later on, but for the most part,      

304
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,307
I've done the creating of the Data Model,      

305
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:24,745
and the Data Binding part of it,      

306
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:27,461
and we'll continue on in the next lesson,      

307
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:31,068
as we move on from there, okay.      

308
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:31,896
Thank you.
