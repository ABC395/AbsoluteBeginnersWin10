00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:08,553
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net,</v>      

2
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:10,078
and this is the challenge that I call      

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:13,720
the Adeptly Adaptive Challenge.      

4
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:19,469
You will be asked to create an apdaptive      

5
00:00:21,024 --> 00:00:25,469
solution for a fake news website.      

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,616
So you can see as I make the application larger,      

7
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:31,762
at some point, at 900 pixels wide, actually,      

8
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:33,350
each of the individual news items      

9
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:36,562
will become extremely large, 400x400.      

10
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:39,857
When we go with the smaller size,      

11
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:42,396
it's more like 200x275.      

12
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:46,401
Also when we get larger you can see that      

13
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:51,344
the title grows from an 18 point font to a 26 point font,      

14
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:52,487
and there are instructions for this      

15
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,395
I'll call your attention to in just a moment.      

16
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:57,344
Furthermore, if we were to run this on      

17
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:01,745
mobile you wouldn't be able to see      

18
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,814
this SearchBox any longer,      

19
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,285
it would be hidden, the visibility would be collapsed.      

20
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:11,850
And we'll talk about which of which of the techniques      

21
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:15,661
that you've learned you should use to make that happen.      

22
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:17,727
Alright, so let me shut that down.      

23
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,968
I'm giving you the resources with this lesson      

24
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,780
and it'll include a number of different things      

25
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,299
like screenshots of things that we just looked at      

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,781
in the live demo.      

27
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:28,871
Furthermore there are a series of instructions,      

28
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:31,229
I highly recommend you keep these handy.      

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,185
You're going to create just the beginning of a fake news app.      

30
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:36,966
Now if this were a real app,      

31
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,791
we'd go out to an online service,      

32
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:41,265
pull down data, and then Bind to it,      

33
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,175
and we'll do something similar to that      

34
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:45,371
when we get to the weather app      

35
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:48,016
that we'll build together here in just a little while.      

36
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:50,182
In this case I'm going to give you      

37
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:53,359
some hard-coded data to use for the application.      

38
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,716
But essentially each news item will contain      

39
00:01:55,717 --> 00:01:57,914
an image, a headline, a subhead, and a dateline.      

40
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:01,794
So when you're going to create a NewsItem class,      

41
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,844
and it's going to have these properties,      

42
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:08,684
and you're going to then create      

43
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:12,343
a bindable Collection of these items      

44
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:15,978
and then Bind to them using a GridView.      

45
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,536
Let me see if there's anything in here,      

46
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:18,517
I would highly recommend      

47
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:19,979
that you read through this thoroughly.      

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,580
I'm going to give you all the images that you'll need      

49
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,384
so there are five Financial images,      

50
00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:27,509
five Food images that you'll use.      

51
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,057
They correspond with data that I'm going to give you      

52
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:31,156
in this little helper method,      

53
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:34,589
that's to be used with the Manager class that you'll build.      

54
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,599
So here's a little helper method that will return a list      

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,008
of five Financial news stories,      

56
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:43,324
and five Food news stories.      

57
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,926
I give you, let's walk through this.      

58
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:52,790
Use techniques that we discussed previously to create this.      

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,114
Having said that you're only going to need to create      

60
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:01,178
a MainPage.xaml so we not going to      

61
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:05,367
utilize the device family-specific view.      

62
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,686
Instead we're going to do this all      

63
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,449
with the Visual State Managers and Adaptive Triggers.      

64
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:14,387
You're going to use a GridView,      

65
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:16,520
you're also going to create a User Control      

66
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,820
that will store those values,      

67
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,752
because you'll have to use that technique,      

68
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:23,874
because we're going to re-size each of the individual      

69
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:27,880
templates for the news items      

70
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,446
in the DataTemplate for the GridView.      

71
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:35,229
I think a lot of this is self-explanatory.      

72
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,036
Just have a keen eye here towards these two items.      

73
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:42,302
Each NewsItem should be 200x275 when in a narrow state,      

74
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:46,855
400x400 wide in a wide state.      

75
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:50,108
The wide state I'm defining as 900 minimum window width.      

76
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,060
And then the AutoSuggestBox,      

77
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,292
when the width is less than 400 should be hidden.      

78
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,937
So the only way you would really be able to see this      

79
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:58,832
because you can't see it      

80
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,709
when you're running on the local machine      

81
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,253
is when you actually run it on      

82
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:05,345
one of the smaller device emulators.      

83
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,373
So let's go ahead and run that real quick.      

84
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,077
Now, just to note,      

85
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:17,635
We're not actually implementing the AutoSuggestBox,      

86
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:19,021
we're not implementing Search,      

87
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:22,616
I just want you to be able to successfully use      

88
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:24,652
the VisualStateManager to Show and Hide      

89
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:27,693
based on the Width of the window.      

90
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:30,923
And so again, when it's less than 400 pixels wide,      

91
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,340
the visibility of that      

92
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:43,672
AutoSuggestBox should be collapsed,      

93
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:46,451
and when it's greater than 400 it should be visible.      

94
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:49,621
And I think that's all      

95
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,365
that I really wanted to say about this.      

96
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:57,733
I give you all of the Segoe MDL2 assets that you'll need,      

97
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,029
the Colors, the FontSizes, the Margins.      

98
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,807
When in doubt reference the screenshots that I give you,      

99
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:08,331
A, B, and C, that are available in that folder.      

100
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:11,921
And then obviously here this helper method      

101
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:14,420
which will give you      

102
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,828
the list of news items.      

103
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:22,414
This should probably take you 40, 45 minutes      

104
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:25,715
if you make no mistakes and you know what you're doing.      

105
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:26,909
If you're new to all of this      

106
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,932
it might take a little bit longer.      

107
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,247
Don't get discouraged, keep struggling, pushing through,      

108
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,658
you can do this, I know you can.      

109
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,451
Reference the videos and the cheatsheet      

110
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,135
that we just went over previously,      

111
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,234
and I know you can figure this out.      

112
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,486
Just want you to get some hands-on exercise.      

113
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:41,542
All right, so if you get stuck,      

114
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:43,185
take a look in the next videos.      

115
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:45,019
I've split them out so that you can find the part      

116
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,537
that is pertinent to what you're looking for.      

117
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:49,339
I hope that helps, and good luck,      

118
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,726
and I know you can do this.      

119
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:51,684
Thanks.
