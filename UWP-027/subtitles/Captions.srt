00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:08,478
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net</v>

2
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,130
and in this lesson we're gonna talk about

3
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:13,210
the Canvas Layout Control, as well as shapes.

4
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:15,758
Now, they're not inextricably tied together,

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,194
but you'll see that they are complementary ideas.

6
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,658
We're dealing with absolute placement

7
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:24,186
of Controls on a design surface.

8
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:28,918
So, typically, in layout of Windows applications,

9
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:33,342
we do not want to have absolute layout

10
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:36,898
or absolute positioning because if we resize

11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,502
the application we would have to either

12
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:42,358
do a lot of math to factor out where

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,614
things should be, or we really are

14
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:49,106
just limited the form factors that can consume

15
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:50,590
our application.

16
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:53,446
So, typically you wouldn't use this in

17
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:56,050
any applications that you typically would see

18
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,570
installed in Windows, but there are some

19
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:01,090
use cases, some scenarios where I thought

20
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,582
this would be helpful, so in the interest

21
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,634
of making sure you have a pretty broad knowledge,

22
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,622
maybe perhaps not all that deep,

23
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:10,610
but a broad knowledge of your options

24
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,326
with building applications, I wanted to cover

25
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,846
both the Canvas and different shapes.

26
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:18,898
So you might need to build apps that deal with

27
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:21,614
music, musical staffs, musical notation,

28
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:25,030
or perhaps applications that deal with math

29
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:26,934
and it needs symbols and you need lines

30
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,174
and you need some different places,

31
00:01:29,175 --> 00:01:31,386
you know, math can get kind of hairy

32
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:34,214
with the formulas and where they're placed.

33
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:38,498
Analog clocks, so they can create different angles

34
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,018
for lines, and things of that nature,

35
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:45,246
even a diagram application, or a drawing application,

36
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,346
perhaps you want to create two symbols

37
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:48,970
and then draw a line between them

38
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:50,678
that has some meaning inside of

39
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:54,374
your particular industry, or even applications

40
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:59,330
that deal with bar readers, or create bars for scanners.

41
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,934
All of those are good scenarios for working with

42
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:04,902
both a Canvas and with shapes.

43
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:07,394
Okay, so the first thing I wanna talk about

44
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,746
is the Line shape.

45
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:10,978
And the Line is pretty simple.

46
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,430
It doesn't need to be put inside a Canvas at all,

47
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,942
you can put it inside of a Grid

48
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:19,826
and you can see here what we get as a result of that.

49
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:22,906
Here we're putting it inside of the default Cell,

50
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:27,764
we're just specifying the X and Y

51
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:30,718
coordinates for the beginning and the end.

52
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,258
So here's the beginning point.

53
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:35,254
X="10" and Y="10", so that gives it

54
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,410
this left-most corner here.

55
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,314
And then the second point would be

56
00:02:39,315 --> 00:02:43,458
X="200", Y="10", so that's gonna give us

57
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,686
a nice vertical line because the Y's don't change,

58
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:49,226
only the X values.

59
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:53,146
That gives us that point up here on the right-hand side.

60
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:55,498
You can see that we've said the Stroke="Black"

61
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:57,430
and the StrokeThickness="5",

62
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,902
and then we also set the StrokeEndLineCap="Triangle"

63
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:01,770
StrokeEndLineCap="Triangle"

64
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,534
There's a couple different options here,

65
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:06,222
you can see that we can create a Flat, Round,

66
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:09,414
Square or Triangle, and let me scroll actually,

67
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,178
just go to 100 here.

68
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:12,970
You can see, by choosing Triangle we get

69
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:16,190
that little arrowhead on the end.

70
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,318
So like I said, we can actually,

71
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,318
we don't need Grids, I'm sorry a Canvas

72
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:28,230
in order to create various Line Objects

73
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,882
and add them to our application.

74
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:31,926
As you can see here, I created a triangle

75
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,996
by creating three more Lines and making sure

76
00:03:33,997 --> 00:03:36,406
that they intersect at just the right spot,

77
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:40,548
making sure that their StrokeStartLineCap

78
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:47,147
is set to Round, and that the StrokeEndLineCap

79
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:50,031
is set to Round so they have a nice rounded appearance

80
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:53,587
on the corners and they come together nicely.

81
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:57,871
Now, I did want to talk about the Canvas,

82
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,960
because the Line, you can see that we're

83
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:02,284
doing absolute placement by choosing

84
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,992
an X,Y coordinate.

85
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,092
If we were to change this to Canvas,

86
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:07,828
nothing about the Line changes, but now

87
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,516
we'll be able to get that same treatment

88
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:15,360
to any other Control by using an Attached

89
00:04:15,361 --> 00:04:17,824
property syntax.

90
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:22,472
So let's recreate, first of all, before we go further,

91
00:04:22,473 --> 00:04:26,336
this triangle using a different type of object.

92
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:28,240
Instead of using three Line objects,

93
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,320
we can just create a Polyline object.

94
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:33,672
Here you can see that I'm setting,

95
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,548
I am using Attached properties actually,

96
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:38,320
to set the left and the top of the Polyline,

97
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,924
and then I start creating a series of Points,

98
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:45,924
so X,Y pairs that define the various Points

99
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,296
of my Triangle, and then I can even

100
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:52,852
set the Fill color for my Polyline,

101
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:55,680
if it all joins together.

102
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,668
But notice that I'm placing this entire

103
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:02,668
Polyline here at 150 Left, 0 Top,

104
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:04,864
so everything now, all these Points

105
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:09,864
are relative to that position that I defined.

106
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:14,737
Next, just to kind of emphasize the

107
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:18,853
absolute placement of items here,

108
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,757
I'm creating a TextBlock

109
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:22,655
and I'm setting it to Canvas style Left

110
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,575
and Canvas style Top to 50 and 150 respectively.

111
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,515
And so we can put anything, not just Shapes,

112
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:34,107
any Control inside of a Canvas for absolute placement.

113
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:37,215
Alright, and then we talked about,

114
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,875
I think we've used the Rectangle in the past,

115
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,443
let's go ahead and use the Rectangle here

116
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:43,655
and I'll add it to another example.

117
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:46,511
So here I have just a yellow rectangle.

118
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,487
Again, setting the Canvas.Top Attach property

119
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:53,483
and the Left="0", the Height and the Width,

120
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:56,227
and I Fill it with the color Yellow.

121
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:58,299
You'll notice that I have this ZIndex Property,

122
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,343
and that'll allow me to talk about

123
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,563
the last thing that we wanna discuss here

124
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,859
with regards to the Canvas.

125
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,247
And the Canvas allows you to place items

126
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:12,775
on top of each other, but define

127
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:17,171
which ones will come if you were to stack them up

128
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,627
and you were to look at them kind of

129
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,971
in a different perspective,

130
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,343
what would the stack be?

131
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:22,603
So which one is visible first?

132
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:26,915
In this case, I set the ZIndex of the Ellipse

133
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:31,915
to 150 and the ZIndex of the yellow Rectangle to 100.

134
00:06:32,068 --> 00:06:36,071
If I change that, you can see that by changing

135
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:40,215
the ZIndex to 15, it puts the yellow Rectangle

136
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:46,459
on top of the Ellipse.

137
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,567
So, we are talking in terms of X and Y-Coordinates,

138
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:51,359
but also there's a Z-Coordinate

139
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,915
in 3-D space, and so the ZIndex will set

140
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,275
that stacking order for you.

141
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,675
So just be aware of that.

142
00:06:59,676 --> 00:07:01,691
Okay, that's really all I wanted to say

143
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,679
about Canvas and the various Shapes

144
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,639
that are available, you can combine these

145
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,599
in interesting ways to pretty much

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,267
represent anything that you could imagine.

147
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:14,263
If you need to draw Shapes in your application.

148
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:15,383
So hopefully that's helpful.

149
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:18,687
I think they mostly have, all of them have,

150
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:23,307
like Click or Tapped, yeah.

151
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:27,255
So if you needed to respond to touch or click,

152
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:32,099
you would use the Tapped event to handle that event

153
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,863
if the user were to try to interact

154
00:07:33,864 --> 00:07:35,683
with that given Shape as well.

155
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:37,811
So that's all I wanted to say about the Canvas

156
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:41,983
for absolute placement, and then the Shapes

157
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:45,763
for special use cases where you need to draw

158
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,395
on your application.

159
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:49,935
Alright, hopefully that was helpful.

160
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,111
We'll see you in the next lesson.

161
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:52,705
Thanks.
