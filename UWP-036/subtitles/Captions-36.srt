1
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:08,705
<v Voiceover>Alright, this is the last of the solution videos</v>

2
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:11,542
for the Stupendous Styles Challenge.

3
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:14,178
And now we're going to work on the CompletePage.

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,405
I'm going to show you a little something

5
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:17,900
I failed to talk about during the regular videos,

6
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:20,135
and you're going to see this at work.

7
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:23,904
It's a pretty cool feature of Styles.

8
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:26,580
I kept saying that they're like Cascading Style Sheets.

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:29,140
But I never really demonstrated that notion,

10
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:30,292
we'll do that now.

11
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:35,292
Okay, so what I'm going to do is borrow actually from

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,073
the DonutPage again.

13
00:00:39,074 --> 00:00:43,200
Let me just grab all of this here.

14
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:45,920
That's all I need for now.

15
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:49,087
Paste that in there.

16
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:55,261
And, what I'll do...now notice here, you know,

17
00:00:55,521 --> 00:01:00,112
if we take a look at what do we got?

18
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:04,677
Yeah, we're going to use the color logo here, right?

19
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:07,504
But you'll notice that I copied in the Style

20
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:10,267
that points to the WhiteLogoStyle.

21
00:01:10,268 --> 00:01:11,547
That's true.

22
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:14,896
But what if I just override that one attribute

23
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:18,468
of the Style that was created on the WhiteLogoStyle

24
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:22,041
that sets the Source equal to the

25
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:25,719
color logo instead.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,639
Will that work?

27
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:29,468
Let's see.

28
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:31,975
Got to make sure I spelled it right first.

29
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:33,798
Or else it'll be anticlimactic.

30
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,010
Okay, here we go.

31
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:44,368
Whoa, same size, same spacing, everything's the same

32
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,398
except its color.

33
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,165
So you see I was able to borrow from the Style

34
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,052
but override the things that I needed

35
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:56,227
to be different about the Style.

36
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:00,249
And that is how Styles in XAML

37
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,109
are like Cascading Style Sheets, so cool.

38
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,669
Alright, but that's not all we need to do here.

39
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,963
We also need to work with this ticket

40
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:12,381
and with this Order 96, and all that business, right?

41
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:16,717
And so, let's go ahead and first of all,

42
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:19,149
I'm going to add that Image.

43
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,234
Grid.Row="1", in fact, I think I only need

44
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:26,263
two Rows here.

45
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:28,843
So, let me get rid of that.

46
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:31,280
Okay, alright.

47
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:34,779
Yeah, the first Row is going to be for our logo.

48
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,806
But the second Row, Row 1,

49
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:39,334
that's where all the magic's going to happen

50
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:40,709
for the CompletePage.

51
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,092
So, let's set the Source="Assets/ticket.jpg"

52
00:02:44,093 --> 00:02:49,092
Source="Assets/ticket.jpg".

53
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:54,521
And I'm going to set the Vertical and HorizontalAlignments

54
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,054
equal to "Center".

55
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:05,200
And we'll see where that takes us.

56
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:07,046
Now I'm pretty sure this image is going to get

57
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:10,342
just ginormous, so we're going to have to come back

58
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:11,419
and address that.

59
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,135
The other thing I want to do, though is add a StackPanel.

60
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,509
And inside that StackPanel we're going

61
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,242
to put two TextBlocks.

62
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:26,543
And the Text in the first one will be the "Order",

63
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,138
and then the Text in the second one will be that "96".

64
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,519
Again, this is just a mock up, no real functionality here.

65
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,447
I'm going to set the FontSize on the second one

66
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,626
equal to "64".

67
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:42,415
Pretty big.

68
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:47,018
And then the FontSize on the first one to "36".

69
00:03:48,891 --> 00:03:50,960
HorizontalAlignment="Center".

70
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,016
And I don't think I'm going to need

71
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:54,425
to touch the VerticalAlignment

72
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:00,957
because I'm actually going to do that

73
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,073
here in the StackPanel.

74
00:04:04,307 --> 00:04:09,306
So a Grid, we're also putting this in Grid.Row="1".

75
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,910
Now remember one of the qualities of working

76
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,531
with the Grid Rows is that you can put as many things

77
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,195
as you want in them and they'll be stacked

78
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:17,112
on top of each other.

79
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:20,366
And I'm actually counting on that to happen.

80
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,107
So, VerticalAlignment="Center".

81
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:27,255
HorizontalAlignment="Center".

82
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:31,053
Alright, so we should be good to go now.

83
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:31,800
Let's see what we have.

84
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,229
Now I know that the Image is going to be

85
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,277
ridiculously large.

86
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:38,689
So, I'm going to have to come back and resize that, yeah.

87
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,332
That's ridiculous.

88
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,857
And I don't see my TextBlocks.

89
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,773
What happened?

90
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:45,906
Alright, so clearly we got some issues here

91
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:47,061
we got to address.

92
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:55,413
Let's set, let's put the,

93
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:57,876
the Width of this thing to "300",

94
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:58,777
that should help.

95
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:06,271
Oh, you know what?

96
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,436
I'm a knuclehead, we don't need these Columns.

97
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:10,408
That's the danger of cut and paste, right?

98
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:12,745
You get stuff and you forget that you have it in there.

99
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,569
That should fix that issue.

100
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,115
And complete, yeah, it looks,

101
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:22,922
well, it looks pretty close.

102
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:27,326
Something not quite right about the centering on this.

103
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:32,733
But, I think it's good enough for now.

104
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:33,970
All right, so we're going to go with that.

105
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:37,000
And that is basically the solution to

106
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:39,111
the Stupendous Styles Challenge.

107
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:43,358
I hope you were able to use Styles as much as possible.

108
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,876
If you were able to use them more than I was,

109
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:50,988
then you get bonus points for that, that's aweome.

110
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,286
And hopefully you saw the value

111
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,534
of the Styles here and there.

112
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:58,694
And you got to play around with some logic.

113
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:01,574
You got to work with Layout.

114
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:03,792
Some of the things we did previously,

115
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:06,640
you get to strengthen those muscles

116
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:10,191
like working with a Frame and navigating around, okay?

117
00:06:10,192 --> 00:06:11,205
So, let's move on.

118
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,726
Now we're going to get to the more complicated,

119
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:13,685
interesting stuff.

120
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:14,838
This is when things start to get fun.

121
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,134
So wake up, and let's get going.

122
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:19,040
See you in the next lesson.

123
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,664
Thanks.
