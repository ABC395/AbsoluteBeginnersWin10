00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,319
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.learnvisualstudio.net</v>

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,819
and in this lesson we'll talk about

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,189
the second new layout control in the

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,449
universal Windows Platform API, the SplitView.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,889
And the SplitView allows us

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,419
to create a panel that can be displayed

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,449
or hidden, and there's a little animation

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,889
associated with it so it looks like

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,209
it slides out and slides back,

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,829
into view and out of view.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,249
So we would use the SplitView

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,489
to implement that hamburger navigation style

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,519
that is used in Windows 10,

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,619
like we saw in the previous lesson.

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,189
There are two parts to a SplitView.

16
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,149
One might be optional.

17
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,169
The other is required.

18
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,419
The part that's hidden by default that you display,

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,889
that's called the pane.

20
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,949
The part that's already displayed and can either

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,289
be overlapped, or it can be pushed over,

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,019
that's called the content.

23
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,049
Not sure that you have to have a content.

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,119
It'll work, I believe, without it.

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,909
But we're going to go ahead

26
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,519
and demonstrate it with it.

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,599
What you do is, you then implement

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,889
or define other controls

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,269
inside of the SplitView pane

30
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,359
and the SplitView content areas

31
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,259
that make up your application.

32
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,049
In the SplitView pane, what you want to do is to,

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,519
if we were to create a real application

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,519
that used the hamburger navigation style,

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,319
we'd have an icon and then text next to it.

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,259
And we'll get to that.

37
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,919
We'll build that in a couple lessons from now.

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,189
But we're just going to start with the basics

39
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,859
of just this component itself,

40
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,289
although it is a large piece of the overall puzzle

41
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,619
to make that happen.

42
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,189
Alright, so let's start by building a SplitView.

43
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,919
Here in my new application called "SplitViewExample."

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,019
So we're going to create a SplitView,

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,019
and inside the SplitView

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,039
we're going to create a pane,

47
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,889
and then a content area.

48
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,319
So inside the content area we can do

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,649
anything we want to do.

50
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,449
I'm going to actually just put a bunch

51
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,651
of TextBlocks for all of these.

52
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:11,569
Set the text equal to ...

53
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,275
So I'm going to create

54
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,845
just simple TextBlocks

55
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,385
in both the pane and the content area.

56
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:22,785
I'll just fill in some text

57
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,815
so we can distinguish it.

58
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:29,125
The first, second and third TextBlock will be in the pane.

59
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,455
The fourth,

60
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:37,645
fifth and sixth TextBlock

61
00:02:37,646 --> 00:02:40,685
will be in the content area.

62
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:42,385
Now as you can see, we get the little error

63
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,555
that the property content can only be set once.

64
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:45,975
Why?

65
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:48,855
Because it has content property,

66
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:50,185
not a child property.

67
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:53,265
We're going to use a StackPanel or something else then

68
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:57,885
to enclose all of our items inside of each

69
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,605
the pane and this content area.

70
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,345
Alright.

71
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,655
Great.

72
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,325
Allright, and you can barely see,

73
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:16,255
let's go ahead and blow this up a little bit more,

74
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:18,225
to like 75%.

75
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:22,025
You can see that we will by default

76
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:25,155
be able to view the StackPanel's pane.

77
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:28,935
Now, if we were to run the application,

78
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:34,725
however, you see that the pane is nowhere to be found.

79
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:38,105
We only see the content area.

80
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,925
How do we actually display the pane?

81
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:43,125
Well we're going to have to first of all

82
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:45,545
give our SplitView a name.

83
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:48,695
So let's do that, MySplitView.

84
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:52,535
And then here let's go ahead and add

85
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:57,155
a Button outside of the SplitView

86
00:03:57,156 --> 00:04:00,205
and call this...

87
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:09,075
And set the Click property...

88
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:13,835
the Click event rather, to Button.Click

89
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:19,785
And inside of here, what we're going to do

90
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:24,375
is work with MySplitView.IsPaneOpen,

91
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:29,925
and we're going to set the IsPaneOpen property

92
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:32,255
and we're going to set it to whatever

93
00:04:32,256 --> 00:04:35,755
the MySplitView pane property is not.

94
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:38,455
So you can see that we're setting it equal

95
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:40,785
to the opposite of whatever it is right now

96
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:43,865
by using the not operator,

97
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,635
the exclamation mark.

98
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:49,645
So now let's do one more thing.

99
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:52,985
I'm going to change this outermost item

100
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:56,365
from a Grid to a StackPanel,

101
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,725
and then I'm going to delete that.

102
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:00,185
And then I'm going to save it,

103
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:03,075
and let's run the application.

104
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:08,255
Alright, so you can see that I can display

105
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:11,185
and hide that panel, very cool.

106
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,815
Now we can control more about that panel.

107
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,453
First of all, let me change this StackPanel

108
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:21,763
to the Orientation="Horizontal", great.

109
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,223
And what we're going to do

110
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:29,223
is set the SplitView's DisplayMode.

111
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:33,953
The DisplayMode is one of the most important

112
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,243
properties that we can set on the SplitView,

113
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:37,953
because it will

114
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:41,093
dictate how it actually operates.

115
00:05:41,094 --> 00:05:43,223
So there's four options here.

116
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:46,503
Let's take a look at Inline,

117
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:49,403
and let's go ahead and run the application.

118
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:53,743
You can see whenever we click Inline

119
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,753
it actually pushes, the pane as it comes out,

120
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:59,803
pushes the content over.

121
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:05,373
Whereas, if we were to change this to Overlay,

122
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:09,095
just going to run the application again,

123
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:13,603
it would completely cover it up.

124
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:16,583
And then there's one other variation on this,

125
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,923
but we're going to have to set another property.

126
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:22,823
We're going to set the CompactPaneLength,

127
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:28,183
and you typically set this to a small value, like 50.

128
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:31,223
Just enough to display an icon.

129
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,753
So this is 50 pixels,

130
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:35,713
and so we'll do overlay...

131
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:39,743
CompactOverlay

132
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,923
This is a variation on overlay

133
00:06:41,924 --> 00:06:44,253
that will display just a little crack

134
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:48,973
of what's underneath in the pane.

135
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:52,323
You can see First, Second and Third.

136
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,643
Let's change that even to just 10 pixels,

137
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,383
just so we can barely see it creeping out.

138
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:01,143
Right now it doesn't look particularly interesting.

139
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:05,083
You can just barely see First Second and Third

140
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:08,083
creeping through there on the very most left side.

141
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:12,203
Then when we click "Click Me," the pane covers up

142
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:15,223
whatever we see in the content area.

143
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:18,623
So that's CompactOverlay.

144
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:21,423
CompactInline is exactly like inline

145
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:24,283
except it shows that little compact area as well,

146
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:26,723
that will only be 10 pixels wide.

147
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:29,053
Here again, we see just a little bit

148
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,653
of First Second and Third text block,

149
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:32,583
and when we click it, it pushes everything over,

150
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,903
because it's Inline.

151
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:40,553
We can also adjust things like the OpenPaneLength,

152
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:45,283
and we can set that to, let's say, 50 pixels for example.

153
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:48,373
Now let's see how that affects our application.

154
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:53,983
So you can see that it really restricts

155
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:58,073
the size of that pane as it opens up, in this case.

156
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:03,283
We can also set the background and things of that nature.

157
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:06,323
Now, here's the thing about the SplitView,

158
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:09,223
is that by itself it really doesn't do much.

159
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:14,053
You're given a lot of latitude to build out

160
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:16,178
how you want to implement your pane.

161
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:18,123
In this case I just used TextBlocks.

162
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:19,723
They don't really make a whole lot of sense.

163
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:21,253
We would want to either use a Button

164
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:22,723
or something that's clickable so that

165
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:26,183
when we click it, we navigate to something

166
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:28,123
in the main area of our application,

167
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:30,543
some feature or some different information.

168
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,463
Again, like I said earlier, we're going to learn

169
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:35,843
how to do that a couple of lessons from now.

170
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:38,303
First, I think we need to learn a couple more

171
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:40,623
input controls that we can use,

172
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:43,043
and once we learn about those, I can show you

173
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:46,253
a very simple way to implement the hamburger navigation.

174
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,983
We're going to come back to this idea

175
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,923
in another lesson or two.

176
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:52,703
So we'll see you there, thank you.
