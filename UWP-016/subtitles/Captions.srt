00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,189
<v ->Hi, I'm Bob Tabor with www.LearnVisualStudio.NET,</v>

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,149
and this is the solution video

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,649
to the Laborious Layout challenge.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,019
Recall, there is no one right way to do this.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,019
Make sure that you are not cheating.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,319
You should actually crack open Visual Studio

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,819
and write some code before you get into this video.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,589
If you don't, shame on you.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,289
Okay, let's get started with a new project,

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,739
and we're going to call this LaboriousLayout.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,989
Let's take a look at the image

12
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,449
while it's getting set up here.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,749
Keep this handy.

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,379
The way that I see this,

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,289
let's get that little top area out of the way,

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,899
is that we have three Grids.

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,919
Each of these Grids are almost identical,

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,449
except they have a different title,

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,889
and the colors of these Rectangles aren't the same.

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,089
I also can see that there are essentially three rows

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,349
and so I am looking at this like a Grid,

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,289
and yet they're arrayed

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,289
with some respect to some stacking.

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,289
So I'm going to enclose the entire area with a StackPanel

25
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,749
and create a Grid, get it to look right

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,389
and then copy and paste it twice

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,989
and change up the colors in the title,

28
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,889
and we should be done.

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,589
Add some margins between each of the Grids

30
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,919
and then we should be done.

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,789
Okay.

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,789
So let's get started and put up MainPage.xaml.

33
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,749
Here again, my recommendation would be

34
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,749
to use this 13.3-inch desktop.

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,809
Let's change that to 100 so we can kind of at least

36
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,719
kind of see it.

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,399
Move this over here to the right.

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,789
So the first thing I'm going to do

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,399
is start with a StackPanel, like I said.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,999
And inside that, we're going to create a Grid.

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,019
And if you recall, the Grid had three rows and two columns,

42
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,789
so let us go Grid.RowDefinitions

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,339
and then below that I'll do Grid.ColumnDefinitions.

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,749
All right, and then the RowDefinitions,

45
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,749
let's go RowDefinition, copy and paste that twice

46
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,019
so we have three rows and then we're going to create

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,569
two ColumnDefinitions.

48
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,289
One of the requirements was that the width of this

49
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,469
only be 500, so let's go ahead and set that.

50
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,419
I'm going to leave the RowDefinition

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,119
set to their default value of auto.

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,049
I'm not going to set that, but the ColumnDefinitions,

53
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,419
we didn't really talk about this

54
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,419
but I'm going to set them equal to 1* and 2* sizings,

55
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,849
like so.

56
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,389
That should give us the desired effect of...

57
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,489
You can kind of see, if you split this in the third,

58
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,319
you have this title area as 1/3

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,319
and then the content area is 2/3, okay?

60
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,519
All right, next up let's go ahead

61
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,149
and start adding the TextBlocks.

62
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,279
There's going to be two of them.

63
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,449
One is going to be for the title.

64
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,119
So Title 1, and we know the font size of that

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,619
is going to be 24.

66
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,619
Equals 24, and it's going to be in the first column

67
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,489
and the first row, so we'll just leave the defaults there.

68
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,449
Here in the second TextBlock, however,

69
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,739
we're going to grab some lorem ipsum text.

70
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,381
We just need that first paragraph.

71
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:46,839
Let's copy that.

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,839
Go back to our project, I'll paste it in right there.

73
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,669
And this needs to be in Grid... whoops.

74
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,989
Whoops.

75
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,749
Yeah, I'm outside the boundary here, sorry about that.

76
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,689
Let me grab both of these guys and put them inside the Grid.

77
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,619
When you are fighting IntelliSense,

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,449
in other words when IntelliSense is not giving you

79
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,849
what you think, you may not be in the right place.

80
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,939
I learned that the hard way.

81
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,219
Let's hit Grid.Row="1"

82
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,312
and Grid.Column="1", great.

83
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,209
All right, next up, StackPanel.

84
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,669
So this is going to be that little area below it.

85
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,419
Do we need that?

86
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,319
Yes we do.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,319
We need it because we want it to be oriented horizontally?

88
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,719
And we need Rectangles. We need three of them.

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,809
In fact, let me just go ahead and do this.

90
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,769
Fill equals whatever, and then the width will be 100.

91
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,149
Height is 30.

92
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,539
Okay.

93
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,349
And the StackPanel will be in a Grid.Row="2"

94
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,669
Grid.Column="1".

95
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,839
All right let's see what we have so far.

96
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,789
Not much because we don't see some things.

97
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,399
First of all, we need to turn on the TextWrapping.

98
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,189
And then let's set the fills on this one, this first one.

99
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,899
Green,

100
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,199
Black

101
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,499
and I believe, Red.

102
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,089
All right, I know I have some margin issues

103
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,939
but I think we're on the right path there.

104
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,349
Let's see what margin issues we have.

105
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,119
There is no margin there, you don't need any margin here.

106
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,119
So the only margins really along the left-hand side,

107
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,619
which looks to be about 20,

108
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,409
and then the amount of space between the end of one

109
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,619
of these Grids in the beginning of the other one.

110
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,619
So let us put the StackPanel's margin

111
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,389
equal 20, 0, 0, 0.

112
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,719
And then we'll put at the end of the Grid actually...

113
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,819
Yeah, the Grid Margin="0,0,0,20".

114
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,039
That should do it.

115
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,439
Okay, great.

116
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,719
All right, so the hard part is over.

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,519
Now let's do this.

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,419
Let's just grab the Grid, whole Grid.

119
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,439
I'm going to paste it twice in this StackPanel.

120
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,249
All right, for the second version of our little Grid here,

121
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,899
we'll Title 2.

122
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,049
Let's look at the picture here,

123
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,039
Red, Black, Blue.

124
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,369
Red, Black, Blue.

125
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,119
And then next one would be Title 3,

126
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,119
and this would be Blue, Black and Yellow.

127
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,689
And before we run it, let me just go over here

128
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,699
to the App.xaml.cs, get rid of the frame counter.

129
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,499
Gone.

130
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,599
And let's run it.

131
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,539
See how close we got here.

132
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,989
Okay, almost right.

133
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,619
Do you see the issue here?

134
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,549
We are centered, and I want to be left aligned.

135
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,669
So let us fix that.

136
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,089
Now I often say that when you write code,

137
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,019
it's more like molding clay than chiseling stone.

138
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,049
So do not be afraid to mold and shape

139
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,549
your applications into place.

140
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,119
Work on them, run them, study them, change them

141
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,009
and repeat the process.

142
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,419
So here we want to do

143
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,619
the HorizontalAlignment="Left",

144
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,349
and that should fix that issue.

145
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,669
Let's see.

146
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,999
Yeah, I think that is the solution.

147
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,119
Runs off to the bottom of the screen,

148
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,289
we'll fix that someday with a whole different control

149
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,189
that'll give us a scrollbar.

150
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,489
But that's the solution, that's one solution.

151
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,079
Hopefully, you got it or got some version of this.

152
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,549
And if not, come back to it tomorrow.

153
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,619
So that is it, now let's move on.

154
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,349
I think you are ready for what comes next.

155
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,749
We'll see you in the next lesson, thank you.
