1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,661
<v ->OK, we're almost at the end of the core functionality.</v>

2
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:10,821
Let us focus then on what happens

3
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:13,061
whenever we get to the end of a round.

4
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,721
We present the user with a play again button.

5
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:16,901
What happens when they click it?

6
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:21,901
We'll want to clean out essentially, and re-stock everything.

7
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:25,681
Grab new songs, refresh whatever

8
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:28,701
the state of the application is.

9
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:33,101
So lets go ahead and begin that process here.

10
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:35,341
So the first thing I know that I want to do

11
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:40,331
is we're going to hit, lets see...

12
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,803
The play again button click event.

13
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:45,923
So, what I want to do here is...

14
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:48,623
We kind of set ourselves up for PrepareNewGame()

15
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:51,523
by creating a helper method that would do this.

16
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:54,903
So we're going to add the await keyword

17
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:56,503
in front of PrepareNewGame() and then

18
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:00,843
I'm going to make this an async method.

19
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:05,183
And then I want to take that PlayAgain visibility,

20
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:10,183
button visibility equal to Visibility.Collapsed;

21
00:01:12,994 --> 00:01:15,034
So now it all really comes down to

22
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,364
whatever we do in the PrepareNewGame.

23
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:19,734
We've already cleared out the songs,

24
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:22,034
we've already picked new random songs,

25
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:27,034
we've already populated the song list.

26
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:31,760
I think we're good to go there, right?

27
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,330
Yeah, Yeah good.

28
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,714
OK, so now the only thing I think we

29
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:38,164
need to do is to start the cool down process.

30
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:43,164
Its StartCooldown(); and I want to fix whatever is

31
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:48,412
in the... the current... all those TextBlocks, right?

32
00:01:48,413 --> 00:01:53,412
So InstructionTextBlock.Text = "Get ready ...";

33
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:59,222
and then the ResultTextBlock, I want to set its

34
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:02,532
text equal to an empty string.

35
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:06,542
TitleTextBlock.Text, empty string.

36
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:11,252
ArtistTextblock.Text equals an empty string,

37
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:16,252
and AlbumTextBlock.Text equals an empty string.

38
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:18,960
Also I want to set the the _totalScore = 0,

39
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:22,798
and I want to set the _round to 0.

40
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:26,166
And that should take care of that scenario.

41
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,926
Alright, is there anything else that I

42
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:32,644
can think of that I need to do?

43
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:37,094
Ideally I would come back through here

44
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:39,214
and I would split all of this code up

45
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,314
into a bunch of little helper methods

46
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,814
and use this kind of as a controller of sorts

47
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,974
that organizes and orchestrates the various events,

48
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:49,814
but I'm going to leave it the way that it is here.

49
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:54,394
Just long passages of code, at least for now,

50
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:55,786
and I think we're pretty much done.

51
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:59,736
So I'm going to run through a round and play this,

52
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,704
and test it and I'm going to pretty much pause

53
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:09,244
the recording of the video, just cut out a lot of this

54
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:11,824
so you don't have to watch me play for five whole rounds,

55
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,164
but when we get to the end with the play again round...

56
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,800
(music plays)

57
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,044
Alright, when we get to that point,

58
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:25,454
then I will un-pause and we can

59
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,794
see what happens to reset the game.

60
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,454
(music plays)

61
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:39,650
Alright, so I hit the end, I actually

62
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:44,616
got three outta five right with a total score of 80,

63
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,364
and I'm going to go ahead now and hit

64
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:50,464
Play Again and it reset everything.

65
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:51,972
Lets just watch it play to make sure

66
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:54,642
that everything got zero'd out.

67
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,290
(music plays)

68
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,600
Alright.

69
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,790
Alright it looks good.

70
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,830
(music plays)

71
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:21,202
Alright, anyway, lets go ahead and quit.

72
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,860
OK, so I feel good about that.

73
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:25,286
The next step for us now is to add in

74
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:27,306
some new functionality where we can

75
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,696
actually try to monetize this game.

76
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:31,310
So we'll start that in the next lesson.

77
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,326
Thanks.
